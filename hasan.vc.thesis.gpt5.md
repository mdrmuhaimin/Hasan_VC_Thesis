# HajjGuide: Venture Studio Thesis

## SECTION 1: STRATEGIC EXECUTION MODEL

**Selected Approach:** **Hybrid Model** – Rocket Internet rigor on supply onboarding, pricing control, and unit economics, combined with BCGDV Solve Model for high-context, regulated in-destination Umrah workflows.

**Justification:**
We occupy the **post-booking gap** where generic OTAs fail — delivering an offline Ritual Mode, licensed local services marketplace, and curated Ziyarah Explorer for Makkah, Madinah, Taif, and Jeddah.  
This hybrid approach leverages proven marketplace and OTA mechanics while solving unique, “hair-on-fire” pilgrimage needs — compliance, offline usability, and high-context guidance.  
By focusing on *in-destination service orchestration*, we create an immediate trust moat in a highly regulated, culturally sensitive environment.

### Evaluation Scores

- **Market Timing:** 9/10 – Umrah volumes are rapidly growing post-pandemic, supported by Saudi Vision 2030’s target of 30 million annual pilgrims ([source][1]). Regulatory enforcement against unlicensed operators is increasing, pushing market demand toward compliant, verified services ([SPA suspension][2], [Gulf News][3]).
- **Team Capability:** 8/10 – Founder Muhammad Raihan Muhaimin (full-time) brings dual strengths in pilgrimage domain expertise and AI/ML product development. Accelerator and pre-seed support from venture studio adds operational leverage.  
- **Resource Requirements:** 7/10 – Licensing, marketplace build, AI-driven offline companion development, multi-language content, and compliance infrastructure require moderate-to-high upfront investment.  
- **Competitive Landscape:** 8/10 – No dominant, vertically integrated in-destination digital platform exists; competitors are either generic OTAs or fragmented offline operators. Our license-first marketplace and offline mode create strong defensibility.

### Team Commitment Evidence

- Founder: Muhammad Raihan Muhaimin — full-time, background in AI/ML and religious tourism.  
- Venture Studio (EIR role) providing structural and funding support for transition to accelerator phase with pre-seed funding upon qualification.

### Scrappy Problem-Solving Examples

- Manually curated flight-visa-hotel Umrah bundles and Hajj Packages for pilgrims via local travel agents; deployed a dua and ritual guidance app that helped pilgrims during Hajj 2026.

### Wedge

DIY Umrah in-destination bundles + offline Ritual Mode + Ziyarah Explorer, trusted and usable without data, with seamless Solo ↔ Hire a Guide handoff.

### Why Now

Rapid market expansion + enforcement-driven shift to licensed operators = timing sweet spot. Generic OTAs are not competing in post-booking, in-destination service orchestration.

### 12-Month “Must Be True” Gates (relative to public beta)

- **Activation:** ≥60% of trip users complete ≥3 meaningful actions in 14 days.  
- **Marketplace:** ≥25% of active users buy ≥1 local service; take rate ≥12%; refunds ≤5%.  
- **Compliance:** 100% of fulfilled jobs by licensed suppliers; complaints <2/100 orders.  
- **Outcome:** ≥70% report ≥5 hours saved or overpayment avoided.  
- **Retention:** ≥20% cross-purchase during trip; ≥30% return to Ziyarah Map within trip.

### Guardrails (Day-1)

- Hajj packages only via authorized providers; D2C focus on Umrah and in-destination services.  
- PDPL-ready consent logs for location/mic; minimal data collection.  
- License-first marketplace (license ID + expiry displayed).

## SECTION 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Industry

Religious Tourism (Hajj/Umrah) and In-Destination Travel Technology.

### Opportunity Description

The global Muslim travel market is projected to exceed **$225 billion by 2028** ([source][17]), with Hajj and Umrah as its most logistically complex and spiritually significant segments. While booking flights and packages has largely digitized, the *in-destination experience* remains fragmented, offline, and dependent on unverified, often overpriced local operators.

### Core Problem

Once in Saudi Arabia, first-time and DIY Umrah travelers face:

- Ritual anxiety from fear of making religious errors.  
- Opaque, overpriced local services without license verification.  
- Language barriers and cultural friction.  
- Crowd and closure uncertainty at key sites.  
- Weak discovery of authentic ziyarah locations.  
- Risk of getting separated from companions in high-density environments.  
Instead of focusing on worship, travelers are forced into constant logistical problem-solving and app juggling.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

DIY and semi-DIY Umrah travelers aged 25–45 from Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and diaspora markets.  
Characteristics:

- App-native and comfortable with digital tools.  
- Booking flights/hotels via mainstream OTAs.  
- Coordinating trips via WhatsApp and social groups.  
- Seeking offline ritual guidance, licensed service providers, and trustworthy exploration.

### Why Incumbents Don’t Win

- OTAs optimize for pre-trip cart conversion, not in-trip decision-making.  
- Pilgrimage decisions are dynamic, context-specific, and fiqh-aware — requiring real-time, personalized guidance.  
- Official channels are essential for permits and inventory, but not designed for concierge-level personalization or hybrid Solo ↔ Hire service models.

### "Hair-on-Fire" Evidence

| Evidence                                                                                                 | Impact on Pilgrims                                        | Source                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Seven Umrah companies suspended (Jun 17 2025)** for failing transport commitments                      | Travellers stranded; ministry had to arrange alternatives | ([Saudi Press Agency][2]) |
| **Ten travel offices shut (Jul 13 2025)** for running unlicensed Umrah services                          | Bookings voided; deposits at risk                         | ([Gulf News][3])          |
| **Real-world delay:** Malaysian pilgrim waited **2 days under airport canopies** then bought new tickets | Lost 48 h + paid extra airfare                            | ([RSIS International][4]) |

### Quantified Pain

- **Time Loss:** Hours wasted per trip resolving logistics and finding trusted services.  
- **Financial Loss:** Overpayment on key services like transport, tours, and mobility aids.  
- **Frequency:** Pain recurs every trip; high stakes for first-timers amplify stress and dissatisfaction.

### One-Sentence Pitch (YC Format)

Independent Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia struggle with ritual anxiety, overpriced unverified services, and poor discovery because in-destination support is fragmented and not fiqh-aware.

###  Defensible Edge & Go-to-Market

#### Our Unique Insight

The critical in-destination gap for Umrah pilgrims is not booking transport or hotels — it’s **ritual confidence, trusted licensed services, and contextual exploration** during the trip. No incumbent integrates offline usability, fiqh-verified guidance, and licensed local providers into a single, seamless experience.

#### Competitive Differentiation**

- **Offline Ritual Mode** — step-by-step, fiqh-approved guidance without internet dependency.
- **Ziyarah Explorer** — curated 4-city pilgrimage maps (Makkah, Madinah, Taif, Jeddah) with Solo/Hire toggle at every point of interest.
- **License-First Marketplace** — transparent provider credentials, verified compliance, pre-quoted pricing, and integrated reviews.

**Go-to-Market Strategy**
Partner with **licensed local travel agencies** in key origin markets to:

1. Sell their **curated Umrah packages** through our platform.
2. Help them **scale digitally** by enabling full online presence and bookings.
3. Embed **in-destination features** (Ritual Mode, Ziyarah Explorer, license-badged services) as value-add differentiators for their customers.
   Initial focus on **Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia**, timed with Ramadan and peak Umrah seasons.

1. **Agency-based end-to-end guided tour** (agency-bundled upsell with escrow).
2. **Transport** (combined: airport⇄hotel + ziyarah fixed-fare).
3. **Private guide** (substitutable by in-app guidance).
   *(Removed: wheelchair; eSIM deprioritized unless agency-driven.)*

## Monetization Signals (interviews + founder inputs)

- **Agency bundles:** Agencies typically pay **2–5% commission**; many offer **B2B rates** for platform distribution. Founder already monetizes as a **Sales Partner**.
- **Transport:** **\~20% referral fee** norms; B2B rates available (e.g., per supplier interviews).
- **Guidance:** **In-app guidance at \$5–\$10** one-time (some up to **\$20**); **private guides** usually bundled with ziyarah or end-to-end packages.

## Validation Preview (for Section 7)

(Concise thresholds kept here for IC clarity; the full plan will live in Section 7 — MVP Validation Plan.)

- **Agency-guided tour (bundled tiers):** Present Lite/Standard/Premium anchored to B2B rates and 2–5% commission norms. **Target:** ≥40% choose any paid tier in interview simulations (or meet channel-benchmark attach if baseline is lower).
- **Transport (fixed-fare bands):** Offer 3 fare bands on common routes + escrow option. **Target:** ≥60% choose a band and accept in-app booking; **Supply-side:** ≥70% of providers consent to the target take-rate (benchmarked to \~20%).
- **Private guide vs in-app:** Side-by-side daily guide fee vs app module at **\$5–\$10**. **Target:** ≥50% select app-only at these price points.

## Operating Assumptions (to sustain Solution Difficulty = 4/5)

1. **No direct fulfillment** (we list/route; we do not operate transport/tours).
2. **Payments** collected by agency or via a **compliant PSP** (escrow/settlement; KYC/AML handled).
3. **License-first supplier policy** with visible badges and periodic checks.
4. **Disputes & refunds** handled by a documented SOP with response SLAs.
5. **Data QA** pipeline for itinerary/hotel/guidance content with offline fallback.

| **H5 — Regulatory compliance**                   | Permit/route enforcement & driver legality are common themes; license-first lowers risk.                                                                         | Users and providers described **checks, stops, and documentation**; **license badges** perceived as trust-building; comfort with **escrow/KYC** discussed.                                           | **Supported.**                                        | Shortlist **PSP/escrow (TBD)**; draft **license audit** cadence & **<72h** dispute SOP.                       |
| **H6 — Guidance engine (AI + curated, offline)** | Desire for authoritative, low-distraction answers; strong preference for **scholar-endorsed** content.                                                           | Pilgrims reacted positively to the idea of **compiled, concise rulings**; caution on accuracy and screen usage during rituals; acceptance higher with **named scholars**.                            | **Provisionally supported.**                          | Build curated Q\&A; set **scholar double-review**; later evaluate AI (accuracy ≥90%, harmful=0, CSAT ≥4.3/5). |
| **H7 — Group-aware routing & tent coordination** | Lost/meeting-point confusion is frequent; printed maps are cumbersome.                                                                                           | Multiple pilgrims recounted **tent-finding** and regrouping issues; interest in **meeting-point cards** and simple timed routes; willingness to **share location** in group contexts.                | **Supported.**                                        | Pilot GPS group mode later; targets: **ETA error ±15%**, **lost-person ↓50%** vs baseline.                    |

| **H9 — Seasonality resilience**                  | Umrah is year-round; diaspora and ziyarah logistics persist off-peak.                                                                                            | Some pilgrims indicated **post-Hajj** and **off-peak** needs; intensity varies by segment and country.                                                                                               | **Partial.**                                          | Define off-peak segments & content; later track **WAU/MAU ≥0.3** and **≥20%** off-peak bookings.              |
| **H10 — Supply-side economics & retention**      | Providers value predictable payouts and B2B pricing; retention hinges on earnings.                                                                               | Providers discussed **payout expectations**, **B2B rates**, and service preferences; churn drivers surfaced qualitatively.                                                                           | **Partial.**                                          | Set **earnings targets** per SKU/market; later track **churn <15%/qtr**, **NRR >100%**.                       |

---

## Section 6 — Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP)

We serve two primary customers—pilgrims (B2C) and group leaders/agencies (B2B)—and one tertiary B2B customer (local service providers). Below is a crisp, VC-ready snapshot in the requested format, plus why each segment picks us.

---

### ICP #1 — Pilgrim (B2C)

- **Target industry:** Faith travel (Umrah/Hajj)
- **Role/Persona:** First-time or occasional pilgrim; the family’s “tech helper” who plans for others
- **Geography:** Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia + diaspora (GCC/UK/US/CA)
- **Business size (if B2B):** N/A
- **Pain points:**
  Clarity on exact steps and sequence; trusted rulings (school/fiqh variants); poor on-site connectivity; cognitive overload during peak days; fragmented guidance across YouTube/WhatsApp/books; language/localization gaps
- **Current solutions used:**
  Human guides/imams; agency briefings; WhatsApp groups; printed handouts/books; YouTube/TikTok; official apps (e.g., Nusuk; local ministry apps)
- **Why they pick us (fit):**
  Offline-first, step-by-step rituals and a simple dua journal, with **cited, scholar-approved** content that reduces confusion at the moment of need.

---

### ICP #2 — Group Leader / Agency (B2B) — *also uses us as a sales channel*

- **Target industry:** Imam-led cohorts; Umrah/Hajj tour operators; mosque groups
- **Role/Persona:** Imam or group leader; agency owner/operations lead who needs standardized, cited guidance for cohorts and lighter support load
- **Geography:** Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia; export segments in GCC/UK/US/CA
- **Business size (if B2B):**
  Imam/mosque cohorts: \~30–150 pilgrims per group
  Mid-size agencies: \~200–3,000 pilgrims per season
- **Pain points:**
  Inconsistent training quality; repetitive Q\&A on WhatsApp; multilingual content gaps; ensuring pilgrims actually follow steps; lack of printable/offline materials; seasonality in demand
- **Current solutions used:**
  In-person workshops; PDFs/printouts; WhatsApp broadcasts; DIY slide decks; reliance on on-site human guides only
- **Why they pick us (fit):**

  - **Cited, scholar-approved content** they can hand to every pilgrim (less repetitive Q\&A).
  - **White-label/cohort tools** to standardize prep across groups.
  - **Sales channel:** we can route pilgrims to their packages and cohorts, supporting **B2B rates** and **2–5% commission norms** (from interviews and our sales-partner experience), creating incremental demand rather than cannibalizing their existing channels.

---

### ICP #3 — Local Service Provider (B2B, tertiary) — *uses us as a sales channel*

- **Target industry:** Transport operators (airport⇄hotel; ziyarah routes), private guides, local ziyarah tour providers
- **Role/Persona:** SME/owner-operator in KSA serving BD/MY/ID pilgrims; wants predictable demand and reputation building
- **Geography:** Primarily KSA (Makkah/Madinah) with BD/MY/ID pilgrim traffic
- **Business size (if B2B):** Micro to SME (single owner-operators up to small fleets)
- **Pain points:**
  Discovery and trust; inconsistent referrals; opaque pricing; disputes and cancellations; compliance/payments friction
- **Current solutions used:**
  Word-of-mouth; brokered WhatsApp groups; agency referrals; ad-hoc Facebook pages
- **Why they pick us (fit):**

  - **Targeted sales channel** to reach relevant pilgrims and groups.
  - **Standardized listings & reviews** to build trust and repeat business.
  - **(Later) Payments/escrow and B2B pricing** to smooth cash flow and reduce disputes—activated only after trust KPIs are met.

---

**Positioning note:** We start with **Pilgrim (B2C)** for trust and usage proof, while **Group Leaders/Agencies (B2B)** provide amplification and early revenue optionality (white-label, commission-based referrals). **Local Providers (B2B)** are a tertiary lane we unlock once guidance trust and governance are established.

## Section 7 — TAM · SAM · SOM (USD)

**TAM (global, GMV): ≈ $35.15B/yr**
• **Umrah:** 13.5M trip-events × **$1,707** avg spend ≈ **$23.05B**. ([malaysiaaviationgroup.com.my][31])
• **Hajj:** 1.833M pilgrims × **$6,601** avg spend ≈ **$12.10B**. ([الهيئة العامة للإحصاء][32])

**TAM (our revenue capture, two views):**
• **Upper bound (100% attach):** Umrah **$59**/trip (2% of package + $5 app + $20 offline), Hajj **$157**/trip → **$1.08B/yr**.
• **Working attach (early-years):** 30% app + 10% package-referral + 15% offline-referral → **≈ $139M/yr**.

---

**SAM (BD + ID + MY, GMV): ≈ $5.17B/yr**
• **Umrah:**
– **Bangladesh:** ~200k/yr × **$1,264** ≈ **$253M**. (Ramadan alone ~100k cited) ([Dhaka Tribune][33])
– **Indonesia:** ~1.4M/yr × **$1,531** ≈ **$2.14B**. ([observerid.com][34])
– **Malaysia:** market ≈ **RM 2.0B** ≈ **$473M** (RM→USD @ ~4.23). ([MalaysiaNow][35])
**Subtotal Umrah SAM ≈ $2.87B**.
• **Hajj:**
– **Bangladesh quota:** **127,198** × **$6,209** ≈ **$789M**. ([Dhaka Tribune][36])
– **Indonesia quota:** **221,000** × **$5,722** ≈ **$1.26B**. ([Arab News][37])
– **Malaysia quota:** **31,600** × **$7,872** ≈ **$249M**. ([tabunghaji.gov.my][38])
**Subtotal Hajj SAM ≈ $2.30B**.

**SAM (our revenue, working attach): ≈ $20.2M/yr**
(30% app @ $5, 10% package-referral @ 2% of local package price, 15% offline-referral @ $20; per-country prices below.)

---

**SOM (12-month, bottom-up; BD → Global English → ID/MY)**
**Channel-constrained, realistic capture (Antler method):**

1. **Paid (Dec. budget $1,000):** CPI ≈ $1.48 ⇒ ~675 installs; 40% activation ⇒ 270 actives. Monetization (30% app, 15% offline, 5% package-ref) ⇒ **≈ $1.6k** in revenue.
2. **Partners (5 cohorts: 3×BD, 1×MY, 1×ID):** assume 200 packages/partner/year; 10% attach ⇒ 100 transactions. Mix 80% Umrah / 20% Hajj → **≈ $7.5k** revenue.
   **SOM (Year-0)** ≈ **$9k–$15k** revenue (pilot scale), expandable with more partners/creative and RM/ID language rollouts. ([zamzamtravelsbd.com][39])

### How we computed prices (all **USD**)

**Exchange rates (Aug 11–12, 2025):** 1 USD ≈ **BDT 121.6**, **MYR 4.23**, **IDR 16,324**. ([MarketWatch][40])

**Hajj average (used for TAM):**
• **Malaysia “Kos Haji” (full cost):** **RM 33,300** ⇒ **$7,872**. ([tabunghaji.gov.my][41])
• **Bangladesh packages:** **BDT 730k–780k** ⇒ **$6,003–$6,414** (avg **$6,209**).
• **Indonesia total cost:** **IDR ~93.41M** (pilgrim pays ~56.05M + subsidy) ⇒ **$5,722** total.
**Mean of BD/MY/ID totals ≈ $6,601** (used for TAM Hajj).

**Umrah averages (SAM pricing):**
• **Bangladesh:** several operators show **BDT ~120k–199k** (mid ≈ **BDT 153.7k** ⇒ **$1,264**).
• **Malaysia:** TH‐linked offers **RM ~7,590–12,090** (mid ≈ **RM 9,840** ⇒ **$2,326**).
• **Indonesia:** typical **IDR ~24–26M** (mid ≈ **IDR 25M** ⇒ **$1,531**).

### Notes & guardrails

* **Hajj/Umrah volumes:** Global Hajj 2024 = **1.833M** (GASTAT). Global Umrah 2023 ≈ **13.5M** (Al Arabiya). Indonesia Umrah 2024 ≈ **1.4M**; 2025 YTD signals growth. Malaysia Umrah volume proxied from **~RM2B** market size; implied ≈ **~200k** trips at mid-price. Bangladesh Umrah: Ramadan alone ≈ **100k** → conservative **~200k/yr** used. ([الهيئة العامة للإحصاء][32], [malaysiaaviationgroup.com.my][31], [observerid.com][34], [MalaysiaNow][35], [Dhaka Tribune][33])
* **Revenue model per trip:** **2%** package referral + **$5** app + **$20** offline referral (local providers). We present **upper-bound** (100% attach) and a **working attach** scenario (30/10/15%) to avoid overstating capture.
* **Rollout emphasis:** **BD → Global English → ID/MY** to match language readiness (Bengali first, then English, then Bahasa).
* **December paid test:** budget **$1,000**; use results to re-fit CPI, activation, and attach for the 2026 plan.

### Quick takeaways

* We sized **TAM** with global Hajj/Umrah volumes and grounded average costs; **SAM** is BD/ID/MY with locally sourced prices and quotas; **SOM** is deliberately **bottom-up** from our December budget and five pilot partners per Antler’s guidance. ([zamzamtravelsbd.com][39])
* All figures are **USD**; exchange-rate snapshots as of **Aug 12, 2025** are cited above.
* We separated **GMV** from **our revenue capture** so we (and VCs) can reason about attach-rate sensitivity cleanly in future updates.

#### CAC — Baseline & Guardrails (your data: **\$1 CPI** via Facebook)

- **Direct formula:** CAC = CPI ÷ overall paid conversion (install → paid).
  At **\$1 CPI**: 2% → **\$50**, 5% → **\$20**, 10% → **\$10**, 20% → **\$5**, 40% → **\$2.5**.
- **Stage model (base):** install→signup **50%**, signup→activation **40%**, activation→paid **10%** ⇒ overall **2%** ⇒ **\~\$50 CAC**.
  Improve to activation **50%** & attach **20%** ⇒ overall **7%** ⇒ **\~\$14 CAC**.
- **Allowable CAC rule (pre-seed):** target **CAC ≤ 60%** of **first-transaction gross profit** (trend to **≤30%** post-MVP).
  Gross profit per tx = **AOV × take-rate × gross margin** (see calculator to plug SKU AOVs).

---

Great call. I’ve updated Section 6 so retention is **trip-anchored** and **no KPIs are tied to post-trip features** (Dua Action Plan stays experimental). Audio is **playback-only**—no voice commands or mic access.

## Section 8 — MVP Design Canvas (VC-Ready, updated)

### Value Hypothesis

For BD/ID/MY pilgrims and group leaders, a licensed, imam-endorsed **offline-first guidance app**—combining **Ritual Mode** (audio playback; **no voice commands**), an **AI Fatwa/Dua Assistant**, and **Ziyarah app-only guidance**—reduces stress and improves confidence during rituals and site visits. **Post-trip features (e.g., Dua Action Plan) are experimental and not included in MVP KPIs.**

### Core Features (ranked)

#### Must-have

- **Offline Ritual Mode (audio playback; no voice commands):** step-by-step checklists, concise rulings, map snapshots, tent/meeting-point cards, low-distraction UI.
- **AI Fatwa/Dua Assistant (text UX):** curated, scholar-reviewed answers; find relevant fatwas/duas by context. Optional playback of answers; **no mic access**.
- **Ziyarah app-only guidance:** historical site cards (Makkah/Madinah/Taif/Jeddah) with etiquette, significance, directions, safety notes — **no provider bookings**.
- **Trust layer:** visible endorsements and citations for rulings/duas.

**Important**: lightweight group location-share + meeting-point cards; Bangla + English (Bahasa/Arabic next); read-only agency package compare.
**Nice-to-have**: saved collections; offline download packs; gentle social proof.

### V1 Exclusions

No KSA provider integrations (guides/drivers), no escrow/payouts, no OTA (hotels/flights), no bidding, **no voice commands/wake word/STT**, no always-on mic.

### MVP Success Criteria (trip-anchored; no post-trip KPI ties)

#### Acquisition & Activation

- **Activation ≥ 40%**: first-session key action (start Ritual Mode, open a ziyarah card, or save a dua).
- **Trip Start Rate** (reporting): % new users who create a TripID within 7 days (no hard target for MVP).

#### In-Trip Retention

- **Trip-Day Coverage Ratio** = days with ≥1 key action ÷ total trip days.
  - Short trips (3–7 days): **≥80%**
  - Long trips (20–30 days): **≥60%**
- **Ritual Coverage**: required ritual checklists completed ÷ expected for trip type.
  - Short trips: **≥80%**; Long trips: **≥70%**
- **Ziyarah Usage**: ≥50% of trip-active users open ≥2 site cards per trip.
- **Audio Utilization**: among users who downloaded audio, ≥50% have ≥1 clip played on a trip day.

#### Trust & Quality

- **Scholarly Trust**: ≥30% of actives view ≥1 endorsement; **source-view ≥25%** on rulings.
- **Safety/Accuracy**: **Top-100 ritual Q coverage = 100%** (scholar-approved); **harmful outputs = 0**; sampled **CSAT ≥4.3/5**.
- **Trip NPS ≥ 40** within 72h of Trip End.

**Note:** **Dua Action Plan** is part of the experience but **not a KPI** at MVP. We’ll observe usage qualitatively only.

## Section 9 — MVP Validation Plan

### Scope & Current Status

I shipped an **offline-first Umrah guidance MVP** (FlutterFlow) with two modules: **Ritual Mode** (step-by-step checklists) and a **Dua Journal**. The released build had **no audio**, **no AI**, **no ziyarah cards**, and **no provider integrations**. Before December, I will add **RAG search (answers with citations)** and **trip-anchored analytics**; I will also formalize an **MoU with Taibah Institute**, who will approve and curate content. I will deploy **whatever is production-ready in the first week of December**.

### Field Signal to Date (Hajj-peak test, June 5–13, 2025; Makkah)

- **Ad spend:** \$59.28
- **Paid installs:** 40 (Men 31 @ \$1.32 CPI; Women 9 @ \$2.01 CPI) → overall CPI ≈ **\$1.48**
- **Organic installs during campaign:** 28
- **Total installs during campaign:** 68 → **blended ≈ \$0.87/install**
- **Cumulative installs to Aug 11, 2025:** **91** (Paid 40, Organic 51)
- **Implied virality (K):** **0.70** during campaign; **≈1.28** cumulative
- **Geo mix (n=91):** ME/India 55; APAC 20; USA/Canada 14; Europe 1; LatAm/Caribbean 1
- **Play Store:** 12 fully organic, founder-led installs

**Takeaway.** Even without analytics or AI, early adoption showed **healthy blended cost** and **encouraging organic pickup** in a pilgrimage context.

---

### What I Will Ship Before December

- **RAG Guidance (text, with citations).** Answers from vetted Umrah/Hajj sources; visible references; refusal policy for out-of-scope questions; offline fallback to Ritual Mode.
- **Trip-Anchored Analytics.** Minimal, privacy-safe event schema keyed to **TripID**.
- **Lightweight Ziyarah & Local Guidance Cards (content-only).** A small set of cards (no bookings) to measure interest/utility in-destination.
- **Localization & Onboarding.** Bangla + English + Malay / Bahasa (if translator available); time-to-first-checklist-action ≤ 60s.
- **Governance.** MoU with **Taibah Institute**; Taibah decides inclusions and phrasing; I enforce verbatim citations and a transparent change log.

---

### Hypotheses in Scope (readable narrative + metrics)

**H1 — Problem–solution fit (Umrah guidance, in peak conditions).**
In December I will validate whether guidance solves an immediate need **during busy periods**. I will consider this passed if **≥40%** of new signups complete a key action in their first session (start a checklist step or create a dua). Because the window is short, **Trip-Day Coverage** will be reported descriptively; for trips that finish within the window, I am targeting **Trip NPS ≥ 40**.

**H1a — Live-during-ritual usage vs pre/post usage.**
I want to know **when** people actually use guidance (e.g., Tawaf). I will classify events into:

- **Live**: a step page is opened ≤2 minutes before the matching **step\_completed** event, on the same Trip Day.
- **Pre**: a step page is opened >60 minutes before its completion (study/prep).
- **Post**: a step page is opened after completion (review/debrief).

**Decision signal.** If **Live Usage Ratio** (Live / \[Live+Pre+Post]) is **<10%** and **Pre** dominates, I will prioritize **pre-Umrah training modules** (Duolingo-style micro-lessons) over live guidance UX work. If Live ≥30%, I will equally be investing in both live ritual UX and **pre-Umrah training modules** (Duolingo-style micro-lessons)

**H2 — Ziyarah & Local Guidance card utility (TripAdvisor-like signal).**
I will add **content-only** cards for a small set of sites and local guidance topics. Success looks like **≥50%** of trip-active users open ≥2 cards, with median **time-on-card ≥20s**. If engagement is high, I will expand toward a **TripAdvisor-for-Makkah/Madinah** content layer (still self-guided, no bookings).

**H6 — Guidance accuracy & safety (RAG + citations).**
RAG answers must be precise, safe, and transparent. The bar is **zero harmful outputs**, **≤5%** ambiguous answers resolved within **24 hours**, and **source-view ≥25%** among active users. Sampled sessions should show **CSAT ≥ 4.3/5**.

**H11 — Brand credibility & endorsements (Taibah governance).**
Success is the **MoU signed**, Taibah-approved content live with citations, and visible endorsement/source interactions (tracked via **source\_view** and **endorsement\_view** rates). **Trip NPS** serves as the downstream trust proxy.

**H4 — Acquisition efficiency & repeatability (trust-first).**
I will benchmark paid acquisition against June’s field test, aiming for **CPI within ±25%** of **\$1.48** (i.e., **\$1.11–\$1.85**). With analytics live, I will report **CAC→Activation by channel** and look for **virality K ≥ 0.70** during the December run.

**H6a — AI vs human-verified usage preference.**
I will measure **RAG query adoption** (share of actives issuing ≥1 query; queries per active; repeat-query rate). If <20% of actives use RAG and **source\_view** remains high, I will emphasize **curated, human-verified answers** and treat AI as secondary.

**H9 — Dua module behavior (preset vs custom; post-trip revisits).**
I will observe whether users prefer **preset duas** or adding **their own**; I will also track **post-trip revisits** (any dua view/edit ≥7 days after Trip End). If post-trip revisits are **≥20%** of dua creators, I will invest in light post-trip habit features; otherwise I will keep the Dua module minimal.

---

### Success Criteria & Decision Rules

**Go (scale content; prep monetization tests)** if:
Activation **≥40%**, **Trip NPS ≥40**, **source-view ≥25%**, **CPI** in band, **K ≥0.70**, **harmful = 0**, crash-free **≥99%**.
Directional signals: **Live Usage ≥30%** → continue live ritual UX; **Card Engagement high** → expand TripAdvisor-like content; **RAG adoption ≥20%** → continue investing in RAG; **Dua revisits ≥20%** → explore post-trip habit features.

**Iterate (tighten trust/UX)** if a single KPI misses by **≤20%** with clear fixes (shorten onboarding to lift Activation; surface citations earlier to lift source-view; refine chunks/reranker to reduce ambiguity; reword card titles to raise card engagement).

**Pivot (content model)** if **harmful outputs persist** or **Trip NPS < 0** despite fixes: move to **curated, scholar-controlled guidance** under Taibah editorial ownership (no RAG answers), keep analytics, and reassess AI later.

**Fallback (business model)** if **self-guided** usage/activation remains weak after a confirmation test: shift focus to **agency-curated flows, package marketplace**, and OTA distribution. Long-term, if obtaining an **Umrah license** is blocked, I will sell via **licensed agency partners**.

---

### Minimal Instrumentation (production)

- **Core:** `trip_start` (TripID, type, est\_length, language), `trip_day_heartbeat` (first key action per day, key\_action), `checklist_step`, `checklist_complete`
- **Timing tags (for Live vs Pre/Post):** timestamps on `step_open` and `checklist_complete` to compute classification windows (≤2m, >60m, after-complete)
- **Cards:** `card_open` (type=ziyarah/local, site\_id/topic, offline y/n), `card_dwell_ms`
- **RAG:** `rag_query`, `rag_answer_shown` (source\_ids), `answer_feedback`
- **Dua:** `dua_journal_open`, `dua_created` (preset/custom), `dua_view`, `dua_edit` (with trip/post-trip flag)
- **Trust & Feedback:** `source_view`, `endorsement_view` (if present), `nps_submit`
- **Acquisition:** `install_source`, `campaign_id`
- **Stack:** Firebase (+ BigQuery) or Amplitude; offline queueing; no PII

---

### Reporting Pack After Early-December Deploy

- **Activation**, **CPI**, **CAC→Activation (by channel)**, **Virality K**, **Trip NPS**, **source-view rate**, stability, and **Taibah endorsement status** with sample **cited answers**.
- Feature-direction signals: **Live Usage Ratio**, **Card Engagement**, **RAG adoption vs curated usage**, and **Dua preset/custom split** with post-trip revisit rate.

---

### Out of Scope for This Cycle (Deferred)

I will not test **H3 (WTP/take-rates)**, **H2/H8/H10 (marketplace liquidity, escrow, supply-side economics)**, or **H12 (OTA adjacency)** until content and trust KPIs above are reliably met. Longer-term, I will pursue the **Umrah license**; if licensing remains a blocker, I will distribute through **licensed agency partners**.

- **Activation**, **Trip NPS**, **source-view rate**, **CPI**, **CAC→Activation (by channel)**, **Virality K**, **stability**, and **Taibah endorsement status** with sample **cited answers**.
- One-page appendix with **June Makkah signals** and **December deltas**.

---

## Section 10 — Pivot Plan (VC-Ready)

### Scope anchor
I shipped an offline-first **Umrah Ritual Guidance + Dua Journal** MVP. Before early December I will add **search over vetted sources with citations (RAG)** and **trip-anchored analytics**, governed by an **MoU with Taibah Institute** (Taibah approves what goes in; I implement). This plan defines how I will pivot if December signals are weak and the guardrails I’m putting in place against company-ending risks.

---

### Backup hypothesis (if the MVP fails)
**Pre-Umrah Trainer.** If live, in-ritual usage is weak in peak conditions, I will shift the product’s core value from “live help during Tawaf” to **pre-trip preparation**: short, structured lessons (Duolingo-style), printable/checklist packs, and curated scholar-approved content under the Taibah MoU. Ritual checklists and the Dua Journal remain; the emphasis moves to “arrive prepared and confident.” Distribution leans on imams, group leaders, and agencies.

### Alternative segment
**Imams and group leaders who run Umrah groups** (Bangladesh/Malaysia/Indonesia + diaspora). They want standardized, cited materials to give pilgrims pre-trip and light, opt-in progress signals during the journey. This segment already spends on training/materials and has clear willingness to adopt tools that reduce confusion.

---

### Pivot triggers (explicit)
- **Pre-Umrah Trainer:** Live Usage Ratio **<10%** (vs Pre/Post) despite UX improvements.  
- **Curated Companion (no RAG):** any harmful output, or trust stays low (**NPS < 0**) after fixes.  
- **Agency-Led Edition:** activation **<25%** after a confirmation test.  
- **Partner-only OTA:** Umrah license remains out of reach; sell via licensed agencies until licensing is viable.

---

### What I will watch for (feature-direction signals)
- **Live vs Pre/Post usage** in Tawaf/Sa’i → direction of investment (live UX vs pre-trip lessons).  
- **Ziyarah/Local cards** (content-only) → if ≥50% of active travelers open ≥2 cards with healthy dwell time, expand toward a **TripAdvisor-like** layer.  
- **AI (RAG) usage** → if <20% of actives use RAG while **source-views** remain high, prioritize **curated** answers.  
- **Dua behavior** → preset vs custom; any **post-trip revisits** may justify light habit features.

    **Guardrail:** multi-currency accounts; invoicing via partners; conservative cash buffers.

25) **Ban on vendors selling Umrah packages without a license, blocking white-label/resell.** — *L:Med I:High*  
    **Guardrail:** avoid resale until licensed; partner-led distribution; prepare license dossier.

26) **CPI spikes above sustainable bands across peaks.** — *L:Med I:Med*  
    **Guardrail:** bid caps; creative rotation; imam/agency channels to lift virality (K).

27) **Runway ends before proof points.** — *L:Med I:High*  
    **Guardrail:** ruthless scope; investor snapshot pre-built; B2B pilots; grant/accelerator pipeline.

#### Team (3)

28) **Bad hire or no hire for BD lead to build Saudi relationships.** — *L:Med I:High*  
    **Guardrail:** interim advisors; part-time BD; clear partner criteria; staged targets.

29) **Context switching (build/sales/content) reduces quality.** — *L:Med I:Med*  
    **Guardrail:** blocked maker time; weekly priority review; async updates; cut non-critical work.

30) **Burnout during or after December.** — *L:Med I:High*  
    **Guardrail:** scope freeze for the sprint; daily “must-ship” list; recovery buffer post-launch.

---

### High-priority mitigation program (cross-cutting)

1) **Trust & safety first:** Taibah MoU, citations everywhere, refusal-first RAG, 24-hour review, curated kill-switch.  
2) **Trip-anchored analytics:** minimal, reliable telemetry to learn from December even at small scale.  
3) **Activation discipline:** ≤60-second onboarding, auto-start first action, localization.  
4) **Offline reliability:** small packs, staged rollouts, low-end Android testing, crash-free target ≥99%.  
5) **Capital efficiency:** concentrate spend on Umrah peaks, lean ops between peaks, B2B pilots to diversify revenue.

---

### Alternate ideas (for future optionality)

1) **Taibah Companion (B2B/B2C):** scholar-curated prep app + printable packs; license to agencies/imams; optional consumer prep module.  
2) **Group Leader Console (B2B):** distribute checklists/reminders; view opt-in milestones; reduce on-trip confusion.  
3) **Masjid Prep Kits (B2B2C):** turnkey workshop (slides + QR packs) ahead of Umrah peaks to drive organic installs.

## Section 11 — Final Go/No-Go Decision (VC-Ready)

### Our call (concise)

**GO.** We will accept pre-seed now and keep validating while we build, using clear milestone gates and pre-committed pivots.

---

### Why now (signals so far)

- **Real need + shipped product.** 30+ interviews consistently surfaced clarity/trust gaps; our offline-first MVP (ritual checklists + dua journal) is live.
- **Efficient acquisition under peak stress.** Hajj-peak test (Jun 5–13, 2025): spend **\$59.28** → **40** paid installs (**CPI ≈ \$1.48**), **28** organic during the same window (total **68**); cumulative to Aug 11: **91** installs; implied virality **K ≈ 1.28**.
- **Risks are governable.** Scholar MoU in motion, citations by default, refusal policy, curated kill-switch; explicit pivot doors if live usage or trust underperform.

---

### What “GO” means for us

We will deploy pre-seed to:

- **Trust & governance:** execute the **Taibah MoU** and ship a cited, scholar-approved Top-100 corpus; refusal-first policy with a curated kill-switch.
- **Measurement:** ship **TripID analytics** (Activation, source-view, K, crash-free) and verify on low-end Android.
- **Distribution:** reconfirm CPI/K with capped micro-bursts while we build imam/agency cohorts and white-label options.

### Decision gates (funding milestones we’ll report against)

| Gate             | What must be true              | Evidence / Target                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trust**        | Scholar governance is in force | Taibah MoU executed; Top-100 approved content live with citations; **0** harmful outputs in audit |
| **Activation**   | First-session value is obvious | **≥40%** complete a key action (start a checklist step or create a dua); crash-free **≥99%**      |
| **Distribution** | Paid + organic are repeatable  | CPI **\$1.11–\$1.85**; virality **K ≥ 0.70** via community channels                               |
| **Direction**    | Live vs Pre/Post is clear      | **Live Usage Ratio ≥30%** → invest in live UX; **<10%** → prioritize **Pre-Umrah Trainer**        |

**Pre-committed pivots**

- **Live <10%** → **Pre-Umrah Trainer** (micro-lessons + printables).
- **Any harmful output / NPS < 0** → **Curated Companion** (no RAG answers; fully cited, scholar-controlled content).
- **Activation <25%** after fixes → **Agency-Led Edition** (white-label via imams/agencies).

---

### Justification (scorecard snapshot)

- **Weighted score:** **6.9/10** — above “keep going,” below “scale.”

  - Problem–Solution Evidence **8.0/10**
  - Trust & Governance **6.5/10**
  - Acquisition Efficiency **7.5/10**
  - Execution Feasibility **7.5/10**
  - Monetization/Licensing Path **5.5/10**
- **Market timing:** recurring Umrah peaks; we handle seasonality with lean ops between peaks.
- **Risk posture:** bounded by the gates above and the pivot map.

---

### YC readiness (0–100, current state)

- **Market Opportunity (25):** **18/25** — BD/MY/ID + diaspora are large; usage is episodic.
- **Competitive Advantage (20):** **13/20** — Scholar governance + citations + offline UX; moat strengthens with endorsements.
- **Team Capability (20):** **16/20** — First-hand Hajj/Umrah + volunteer guide + agency sales partner; fast shipping.
- **Financial Viability (15):** **9/15** — Monetization intentionally deferred; B2B/licensing/OTA-via-partners mapped.
- **Execution Feasibility (10):** **8/10** — MVP shipped; RAG + analytics scoped; low-end Android risks addressed.
- **Strategic Alignment (10):** **9/10** — Hypothesis-first, measurable gates, responsible safety posture.
- **Total:** **73/100**

---

### Investor lens (balanced view)

- **🚩 Red flags to watch:** (1) Scholar MoU execution & review bandwidth; (2) licensing/partner dependencies for OTA/marketplace; (3) episodic usage may cap LTV without B2B/licensing.
- **✅ Excitement factors:** (1) Efficient early acquisition with organic carry at Hajj peak; (2) uncommon trust architecture (citations, refusal policy, curated kill-switch); (3) a telemetry-tied pivot map (Live vs Pre/Post, card dwell, RAG adoption, dua revisits).

---

### Immediate next steps (first tranche)

1. **Seal Taibah MoU** (scope, citation style, correction SLA, logo usage).
2. **Ship minimal analytics** (Activation, source-view, K; crash-free ≥99%); low-end Android QA.
3. **Run a capped micro-burst** to reconfirm CPI band and organic carry with new creatives.
4. **Rehearse safety & comms** (refusal defaults, curated kill-switch drill, takedown SOP).
5. **Stand up partner lanes** (imam/agency cohorts; lightweight white-label pack).

---

**Bottom line:** we proceed with **GO**, release funds against these gates, and treat December as a validation **stage to fine-tune direction**, not as the go/no-go determinant.
