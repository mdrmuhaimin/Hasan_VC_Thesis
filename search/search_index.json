How have we validated via interviews (no build) Preliminary result Next step H1 \u2014 Core pilgrim problem\u2013solution fit Recurrent pains: wayfinding, fragmented guidance, price opacity; trust is paramount. In 31 interviews, \u226590% described guidance/wayfinding/price issues; multiple pilgrims asked for a single trusted app with offline \u201cRitual Mode.\u201d Founder\u2019s 2024 guide role echoed these gaps. Supported. When ready: concierge MVP; target Activation \u226540%, 2-wk retention \u226530%, Net Promoter Score (NPS) \u226540 (post-beta target). H2 \u2014 Marketplace liquidity Licensed transport/guides exist; discovery\u2014not raw capacity\u2014drives pain. Provider/buyer interviews (e.g., agency owners; Driver Solaiman) reported capacity, typical response times, and peak patterns; collected license/permit statements and SLA promises. Provisionally supported. (No live fill-rate yet.) Small concierge fill log (no app): measure time-to-confirm &amp; cancels across peak windows. H3 \u2014 WTP / take-rate viability Pilgrims already pay for agency bundles, tours, transport; guidance WTP $5\u2013$20 (mode $10\u2013$15). Agencies pay 2\u20135%; transport referrals \\~20%. Buyers (who are also experts) confirmed commission norms &amp; B2B rates; multiple users expressed willingness to pay for in-app guidance; founder has paid sales-partner income. Supported (provisional). Structure price-card tallies (n\u226530/SKU) + provider poll (n\u224815) to lock price points &amp; take-rates. H4 \u2014 Acquisition cost repeatability Imam/mosque endorsements, group leaders, agency bundles, diaspora FB/WA groups surfaced as effective. Interviewees named these as trusted join paths; referrer influence noted; we logged acceptable incentives qualitatively. Qualitatively supported. Quantify Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by channel (Cost Per Install (CPI)\\~$1 benchmark); aim payback &lt;3 months; keep affiliate CAC as commission. H5 \u2014 Regulatory compliance Permit/route enforcement &amp; driver legality are common themes; license-first lowers risk. Users and providers described checks, stops, and documentation; license badges perceived as trust-building; comfort with escrow/KYC discussed. Supported. Shortlist PSP/escrow (TBD); draft license audit cadence &amp; &lt;72h dispute SOP. H6 \u2014 Guidance engine (AI + curated, offline) Desire for authoritative, low-distraction answers; strong preference for scholar-endorsed content. Pilgrims reacted positively to the idea of compiled, concise rulings; caution on accuracy and screen usage during rituals; acceptance higher with named scholars. Provisionally supported. Build curated Q&amp;A; set scholar double-review; later evaluate AI (accuracy \u226590%, harmful=0, CSAT \u22654.3/5). H7 \u2014 Group-aware routing &amp; tent coordination Lost/meeting-point confusion is frequent; printed maps are cumbersome. Multiple pilgrims recounted tent-finding and regrouping issues; interest in meeting-point cards and simple timed routes; willingness to share location in group contexts. Supported. Pilot GPS group mode later; targets: ETA error \u00b115%, lost-person \u219350% vs baseline. H8 \u2014 Trust, safety, dispute resolution Fear of overpaying/middlemen; appetite for fixed fares + escrow and transparent reviews. Users preferred escrowed fixed-fare over open-ended quotes; providers indicated comfort with platform-mediated payouts; review usefulness acknowledged. Supported. A/B escrow copy &amp; refund terms during pilots; aim conversion rate (CVR) +15%, disputes &lt;2%, chargebacks &lt;0.5%. H9 \u2014 Seasonality resilience Umrah is year-round; diaspora and ziyarah logistics persist off-peak. Some pilgrims indicated post-Hajj and off-peak needs; intensity varies by segment and country. Partial. Define off-peak segments &amp; content; later track Trip-Active WAU/MAU \u2265 0.60, Global WAU/MAU (T3M median) \u2265 0.30. and \u226520% off-peak bookings. H10 \u2014 Supply-side economics &amp; retention Providers value predictable payouts and B2B pricing; retention hinges on earnings. Providers discussed payout expectations, B2B rates, and service preferences; churn drivers surfaced qualitatively. Partial. Set earnings targets per SKU/market; later track churn &lt;15%/qtr, NRR &gt;100%. H11 \u2014 Brand credibility &amp; endorsements Imam/scholar endorsements and license badges reduce perceived risk and nudge choice. Interview ranking exercises placed endorsements/badges high among trust signals; outreach via mosques worked. Supported. Secure \u22653 endorsements; later A/B badge presence (target CTR +20%, conversion rate +10%). H12 \u2014 OTA / halal travel adjacency (Phase 2) Consolidated booking desire exists; not core to pre-seed. Interviewees expressed interest in one-stop options; also cited existing solutions; focus remained on core SKUs. Adjacent\u2014defer. After core validation, test affiliate APIs; aim hotel attach \u22652%, CPA within OTA norms."},{"location":"#mvp-testable-future-hypotheses","title":"MVP-testable future hypotheses","text":"<p>Based on our primary Hypothesis validation, these are the future hypotheses we are planning to validate with our MVP</p> Hypothesis Why do we believe this?

FH2: \u226525% buy \u22651 service; take rate \u226512% (Marketplace). Transport opacity in 20/30 interviews; WTP mentions (e.g., 1000 Taka) suggest demand. Marketplace pilot with escrow; measure refunds \u22645% in post-funding beta. Validated via Interviews (25/30 support); Needs Beta Testing (no transaction data yet). FH3: Users willing to pay $5-10 for premium features (WTP). Inferred from mentions (e.g., 70-200 Riyal/600-1500 Taka); low explicit but consistent scam avoidance signals. Mock upsells/surveys in beta; test $5 sub conversion post-funding. Partially Validated via Interviews (1/30 explicit, but implied in 20/30 pains); Needs Beta Testing for conversion rates. FH4: Offline mode reduces anxiety for rituals (Usability). Lap counting in 7/30; strong signals for ritual tools (e.g., H6 at 26/30). Usability tests (E2); \u226595% error-free completion in post-funding pilots.
