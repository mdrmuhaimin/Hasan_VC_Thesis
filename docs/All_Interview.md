### **Interview Notes**

Here are the detailed meeting notes from the interview with Abdul Muhid:

#### **Background Information**

* **Trip Type(s) & Year(s):** Abdul Muhid has performed Hajj twice.  
  * First Hajj: 2007, with his parents.  
  * Second Hajj: 2024, on behalf of his father-in-law (who passed away) and with his mother-in-law.  
  * He performed Umrah during Hajj on both occasions but has not travelled separately for Umrah.  
* **Professional Background:** Abdul Muhid is a Procurement Officer at a company called Super Engineering.

#### **Journey / Context**

* **Planning Approach:**  
  * He did not take any formal online courses for Hajj preparation.  
  * He was mostly dependent on the mentoring and coaching provided by the agency he travelled with for his recent (2024) Hajj.  
  * He read various books, specifically mentioning a "very thin book" on Hajj by Khandaker Abdullah Jahangir (Rahimahullah), which he found beneficial for its logistical information.  
* **Agency or DIY Details:**  
  * For his first Hajj in 2007, his father chose the agency.  
  * He emphasizes that it's "important to know their \[agencies'\] manhaj \[methodology/way\] and their experiences" when choosing an agency.  
  * The agency for his 2024 Hajj provided courses, focusing more on educating pilgrims than on money.  
  * Training sessions were live via Zoom or YouTube Live, with recorded videos provided.  
  * He believes "physical training is definitely more beneficial than online training" for pilgrims who are first-time international travelers.  
* **Travel Experience:**  
  * His two Hajj experiences (2007 and 2024\) were "really different" due to changing Saudi Hajj systems.  
  * He attempted independent sightseeing once to Ta'if but faced issues without the Nusuk card.

#### **Pain Points / Challenges**

* **Service Delivery & Logistical Hurdles:**  
  * **Agency Manhaj:** The agency from his first Hajj followed a methodology that led to "unnecessary" acts and exhausted pilgrims with continuous nashids.  
  * **Information Gaps:** Small details like knowing whether to purchase a physical SIM or eSIM can become a major issue.  
  * **Finding Services:** Difficulty in finding good restaurants.  
  * **Language Barrier:** Observed other pilgrims struggling with communication.  
  * **Haram Access & Rituals:** Challenges with entering/exiting the Mataf, rules, timings, and finding washrooms.  
  * **Wheelchair Management:** A "syndicate" exists for wheelchair rentals, leading to pilgrims being "cheated" on prices.  
  * **Mina/Arafat Facilities:** Overcrowded toilets and pilgrims getting lost.  
  * **Personal Comfort & Distraction:** Disturbed by others praying loudly; challenges with personal comforts affecting focus.

#### **Opportunities / Suggestions**

* **General App Features:**  
  * An app that includes Hajj training, agency advertisements, verified pilgrim reviews, detailed ritual guides, and the significance of sightseeing places.  
* **Specific App Features:**  
  * **Logistical Information:** Guidance on SIMs, restaurant recommendations, and conversational Arabic phrases.  
  * **Haram & Ritual Aids:** "Nearest toilet" locations, automatic or manual Tawaf/Sa'i counter, and transparent wheelchair pricing.  
  * **Mina/Arafat Navigation:** A map indicating routes to toilets, shops, and for tracking lost tents.  
  * **Du'a Support:** A customizable "du'a note" section and an AI-powered chat engine to craft du'as.  
  * **Support & Community:** A "support group" within the app for pilgrims to connect.  
  * **Distraction Management:** A warning system for excessive phone use during critical times.  
* **Post-Hajj Engagement:** The app's activities should extend post-Hajj to maintain the "essence of Hajj" within a community.

#### **Quotes & Memorable Statements**

* "The problem is that Hajj agencies are not interested. This is because they have a challenge: their pilgrims' data might be leaked."  
* "You should do something like a B2C portal, like Booking.com, where agencies can come and sell packages."  
* "If there is such an app... through which I can become independent."  
* "The real hassle of Hajj... is that pilgrims usually practice du'as... However, I have seen that when they go there, people struggle with managerial and logistical issues."

#### **Quotes & Memorable Statements**

* **Customer Acquisition:** Majority of pilgrims come through referrals, online campaigns (Facebook), and WhatsApp groups.  
* **Business Philosophy:** Focus is on high-level service and sustainable growth, not aggressive expansion.  
* **Collaboration with Sub-Agents:** Sub-agents are motivated by "pilgrim service." The agency maintains personal relationships with them.

  * Only firm promises are made for services within their control.  
  * Representatives are sent to Saudi Arabia to physically inspect hotels and services.  
* **Nusuk Platform Integration:** The system is becoming increasingly "Nusuk-dependent," making independent travel difficult for pilgrims.

* **Sourcing Credible Services:** The "pyramid layer" system of hotel sales and evolving regulations present challenges.  
* **Nusuk Integration and Costs:** New mandatory requirements are leading to increased prices.  
* **Customer Expectation Management:** Communicating what is and isn't possible is a significant challenge.

#### **Opportunities / Suggestions**

* **Improved Service Quality via Nusuk:** The new system is expected to "ultimately improve pilgrim service."

* "If B2C means creating packages based on customer demand, then we would not be interested."  
* "The system is becoming Nusuk-dependent."  
* "A Bangladeshi pilgrim actually cannot do anything on their own now."

* **Communication:** Agency communication was done in person in a hall; no WhatsApp or mobile apps were used. Information spread via word-of-mouth.

#### **Opportunities / Suggestions**

* **Mobile App for Agency Communication:** Abdur Rahman stated, "I don't think it's necessary."  
* **Advanced Mobile App for Pilgrim Support:**

* **Ineffective Initial Training:** An early training session provided only "10% benefit."  
* **Communication Gaps from Agency:**  
  * Lack of critical information regarding stay duration led to confusion about prayer status (Muqim vs. Musafir).  
  * Current communication methods (WhatsApp, briefings) are "absolutely not effective."  
* **Ritual Navigation:** Pilgrims can "forget things" or "get lost."  
* **Trust in Agencies:** Difficult to select a trustworthy agency without a personal referral; views app-based reviews as "emotional" and unreliable.  
* **Technology Distraction:** Believes using a mobile app for Du'a during spiritual moments would be an "interruption."

#### **Opportunities / Suggestions**

* **Comprehensive Notification System:** An app should send notifications for all Hajj events, both general and agency-specific.  
* **Interactive Checklist:** A dynamic checklist covering all stages of Hajj, with tooltips, links, and quizzes.  
* **Digital Muallim (Ritual Guidance):** A sequential list of ritual steps in the app would make it a "digital Muallim."  
* **Emergency Support:** An "I am Lost" button to alert the agency and an offline support team for ritual mistakes. Prefers direct consultation with scholars over AI for Fiqh issues.  
* **Location Tracking:** Allow agencies to track pilgrims and for pilgrims to see others in their group.  
* **Purpose-Driven App Scope:** Believes an app should stick to its "core focus" and not expand into booking taxis or self-guided tours.  
* **Agency Trust Building:** Suggests agencies use "popular faces" (celebrities/influencers) for endorsements to build trust.  
* **App Monetization Model:** Believes "Bangladeshi people don't pay to use apps yet." Suggests charging agencies a subscription fee.  
* **Pilgrim's Willingness to Pay:** Would pay up to 2000 taka for the app if his agency recommends it and takes responsibility for the service.

#### **Quotes & Memorable Statements**

* "\[Naim Bhai\]: Brother, make an intention. If you make the intention, it will become easy for you."  
* "\[Omar to Naim Bhai\]: Brother, I don't know Shephard, I know you."  
* "The app itself would become their Muallim, a digital Muallim."  
* "I am not in favor of AI... If AI makes a mistake... you really don't have a chance to correct it."  
* "If you're looking at your mobile, your connection with Allah will never truly be there."  
* "Trust is important... take 10,000 taka extra, let me perform my rituals peacefully."  
* "Okay, first of all, I won't pay any money. Bangladeshi people don't pay to use apps yet."

* "The main thing is that this commuting from the hotel to Haram Sharif and getting a fair taxi fare was the big challenge."

  * **Transportation:** Language barrier with drivers and significant overcharging by Asian drivers ("robbery").  
  * **Hotel & Food:** Higher cost did not always guarantee better service.  
  * **Guidance during Ziyarah:** Varying quality and cost of Ziyarah tours.  
  * **Maintaining Concentration:** Challenging to focus on prayers and Duas while following written materials.  
* **As a Business Owner (Implicit):**

* "এশিয়ানরা দেখা যায় ভাড়াটারা অন্যান্য কিছু বিশ্ব স্পেশালি পাকিস্তানি ড্রাইভার যারা আছে তারা হলো যে মানে ফাইভ সিক্স টাইমস বেশি ভাড়া যার কাছে যেভাবে ডাকাতি যেটা বলে সহজ ভাষায় বাংলায় ডাকাতি তারা এটা করে নেয় এবং তারা অনেক ইনজাস্টিস ও করে এবং রুট বিহেভিয়ার করে।" (Asian, especially Pakistani drivers, charge five to six times more, it's like robbery, and they are unjust and rude.)  
* "আমার মনে হয় যে অডিও রেকর্ড পাঠানো বেটার দেন Google মিটে এ চলে আসা কারণ একেকজন একেক কথা বলতেছে এট এ টাইম সবার এটেনশন রাখা কঠিন।" (I think sending an audio recording is better than a Google Meet call because everyone talks at once, making it hard to pay attention.)  
* "আমিও একটা এসআইপি মডেল চিন্তা করতেছি সিস্টেমেটিক ইনভেস্টমেন্ট একটা মডিউল আপনি হয়তো জানেন এসআইপি যেটাকে বলে এটাতে কিভাবে অল্প অল্প করে যোগাযোগ করে অল্প অল্প করে ইনভেস্টমেন্ট করে তার একটা হজমার জন্য একটা প্ল্যান করতে পারবে।" (I am also thinking of an SIP model, a systematic investment module, you may know it as SIP, where one can save little by little to plan for their Hajj.)

* **Language Barrier:** Problematic with transportation in Madinah.

#### **Opportunities / Suggestions**

* **Comprehensive Mobile App:**
