| Pre-trip | Agency distrust/margins | Detected terms: agents, as well as local service providers, so that people can avail some services even if they go by themselves. later on, insha'allah, once the business is a bit established, i might move towards an ota (online travel agency) where people can directly book hotels, flights, and everything through my platform, because to do an ota, one needs to gain some trust, package, almost 41 or 42 days in total. i didn't take any short package. that was a big thing, and in between, i had a big transition. because i used to work in an organization. i worked for almost 19 years. and i always felt, after talking to the doctors (scholars), that the job i was doing, the product i worked with, [best guess: 'stapo'] might not be halal (permissible), and through the sessions, i understood that it's actually not halal. something that harms cannot be halal. by that time, i had worked a lot. i tried to quit my job two or three times during covid. then my colleagues told us, "you can quit when you have time. you need to earn for your family, take care of them. you have made an intention to allah, he will take care of it." then, what will happen is, you will be able to move on beautifully at some point. so, you can do something, keep the intention. so, i feel allah heard that too. in 2021, after quitting my job, i went for hajj in 2022. i tried to pay for hajj from my earnings from 2021 to 2022. the previous one, whether it was halal or haram, only allah knows. i didn't do it knowingly. but this time, i paid for hajj with money earned from a halal job. these things brought a lot of positive impact for me, i felt. i became part of, i mean, by 'part of' i mean, i became a part of this hajj caravan. as a volunteer, as a guide, as a participant in everything. so, that was very necessary for me, and my experience there was very positive in the context that the people who run or conduct this caravan, they try to help people by understanding their mindset, what should not be done. that doesn't mean they repeat their mistakes. they would often say, "we don't sell five-star rooms, we sell for hajj." many people would directly refuse or those who did were well-behaved and very strict. i remember during hajj, we ourselves had many sessions sitting in the hotel room, discussing what would happen the next day, where we would go, even if we had studied beforehand, things can still go wrong. so, this hand-holding part was a comfort. however, one thing i felt was missing there, it's not about the agency. at that time, we weren't, or now we've become very app-dependent. we trust | 4 | 2 | Agency research / DIY forums | Varies | Stress | H1,H2,H10 | Med |
| In-trip | Discovery near Haram (food/shops) | Detected terms: shop, where to buy | 3 | 4 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Frustration | H1 | High |
| Pre-trip | Connectivity & SIM | Detected terms: data, internet | 2 | 3 | Agency research / DIY forums | Varies | Concern | H6,H9 | High |

### 4) Jobs-To-Be-Done
- When I enter a crowded Haram, I want to find toilets/ablution and re-entry paths, so I can maintain wudu and finish rituals calmly.
- When I perform Tawaf/Sa’i, I want a minimal lap counter with undo, so I can focus on du’a without miscounting.
- When I land with luggage, I want fixed-fare vetted transport, so I can avoid haggling and last-mile stress.
- When routes are blocked or timed, I want compliant route/timing guidance, so I can reach safely without fines.
- When I shop or need help, I want simple Arabic phrases and translation, so I can communicate confidently.
