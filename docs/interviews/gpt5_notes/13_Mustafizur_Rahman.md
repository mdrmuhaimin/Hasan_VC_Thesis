### 4) Jobs-To-Be-Done
- When I enter a crowded Haram, I want to find toilets/ablution and re-entry paths, so I can maintain wudu and finish rituals calmly.
- When I perform Tawaf/Sa’i, I want a minimal lap counter with undo, so I can focus on du’a without miscounting.
- When I land with luggage, I want fixed-fare vetted transport, so I can avoid haggling and last-mile stress.
- When routes are blocked or timed, I want compliant route/timing guidance, so I can reach safely without fines.
- When I shop or need help, I want simple Arabic phrases and translation, so I can communicate confidently.
