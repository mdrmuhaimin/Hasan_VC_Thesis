| In-trip | Train impractical with luggage/kids | Detected terms: train uh, was uh, in my mind to be very honest, but i didn't take the train for one reason, because i had a lot of luggages. because uh, so uh, the jeddah airport was kind of a stopover for me, because i was after, after performing umrah and staying there for four days, i uh, went to bangladesh. so i basically came with a lot of luggages. so one problem i thought is that after uh, you know, reaching the uh, makkah station, i still have to find some transportation to go to hotel because i cannot um, like, for, for example, take a, take a bus to uh, reach somewhere and bus would uh, leave me somewhere uh, far from the hotel. so i still have to walk to the hotel. so this is why i thought that if, if i can take a car, then i can directly uh, reach to hotel. and then it would be easy to, easy for me to carry the luggage | 3 | 1 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Frustration | H7 | Med |
