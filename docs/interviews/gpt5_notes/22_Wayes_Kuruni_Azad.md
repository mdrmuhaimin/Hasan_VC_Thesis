### 3) Pain inventory by stage and persona

| Stage | Pain (short name) | Description & evidence (keywords) | Severity (1–5) | Frequency (1–5) | Current workaround | Time/Money spent | Emotion | Related H# | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| In-trip | Permit/route constraints | Detected terms: nusuk, permit | 4 | 4 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Stress | H5,H7 | High |
| Pre-trip | Agency distrust/margins | Detected terms: agency. my younger brother has a separate agency; i do the packages through him. and even the economy packages, we both send them together. what happens is that the service he provides, which i've done here, even though it's being recorded, i have to say that the reviews we get from the customers we send through him are better compared to sending them with other agencies, and we can offer better rates. this is because my younger brother can directly purchase hotels from the hotels themselves, and we have our own login site from which we buy hotels. that's why we can offer competitive rates, as we don't buy hotels through any third party; we buy directly from the hotel owners or authorities. another thing is that it's possible to provide service exactly as desired. and his quality, the transparency, trust, agents who take hotels from us. we give them to customers, and we also give them to sub-agents. but this is still very little because you won't be trusted enough to give sub-agents if you don't have a big marketing setup. so, without big operations, you won't gain that trust | 4 | 2 | Agency research / DIY forums | Varies | Stress | H1,H2,H10 | Med |
