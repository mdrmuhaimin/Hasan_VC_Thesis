|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| In-trip | Facility wayfinding | Detected terms: ablution, wudu | 4 | 5 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Stress | H6,H7 | High |
| Ritual | Lap counting anxiety | Detected terms: count | 3 | 1 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Frustration | H6 | Med |

| In-trip | Language barrier | Detected terms: speak | 3 | 5 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Frustration | H6 | High |
| Pre-trip | Agency distrust/margins | Detected terms: agency. what challenges related to these did you face, and how did you resolve them? regarding choosing an agency, when i went for hajj for the first time, i was young, but alhamdulillah, i was an adult then. i didn't have the choice to pick an agency; my father chose it. however, i can compare the hajj agency i went with in 2024 and the one i went with [inaudible] hajj. if i speak from a sharia perspective, the first time i went for hajj, the agency followed a certain manhaj [methodology], a type of people who are involved with milad qiyam [religious gatherings] in our country. so, what happens is that when you are with them, they perform the hajj rituals by flow. but in between, they perform some acts that are like worship but are not really necessary. and these often exhaust people. for example, if i say, like, we have to travel for about four to five hours by bus from makkah to madinah and madinah to makkah. at that time, they continuously play their nashids [religious songs] or similar things on the bus. so, what happens is that many elderly people want to rest during long bus journeys, but it becomes difficult for them. compared to them, last time, when i went with the recent agency, i did not face these issues. so, regarding choosing an agency, what i understood is that it's important to know their manhaj [methodology/way] and their experiences, which many pilgrims in our country often misunderstand. usually, how do people find out about agencies or trust | 4 | 1 | Agency research / DIY forums | Varies | Stress | H1,H2,H10 | Med |
| In-trip | Discovery near Haram (food/shops) | Detected terms: eat, food, restaurant | 3 | 3 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Frustration | H1 | High |
| In-trip | Wheelchair pricing opacity | Detected terms: wheelchair related issues. i was saying for umrah, if there is a system in the app for wheelchairs, at least the pricing should be there. like, what is the price if i want to hire a wheelchair for tawaf or sa'i today? because there are many types of syndicates or such things, people get cheated. later they realize, "i could have gotten this for 70 riyals, why did i pay 200 riyal | 3 | 1 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Frustration | H2,H8,H3 | Med |
| Pre-trip | Connectivity & SIM | Detected terms: data, esim, sim | 2 | 3 | Agency research / DIY forums | Varies | Concern | H6,H9 | High |

### 4) Jobs-To-Be-Done
- When I enter a crowded Haram, I want to find toilets/ablution and re-entry paths, so I can maintain wudu and finish rituals calmly.
- When I perform Tawaf/Sa’i, I want a minimal lap counter with undo, so I can focus on du’a without miscounting.
- When routes are blocked or timed, I want compliant route/timing guidance, so I can reach safely without fines.
- When I shop or need help, I want simple Arabic phrases and translation, so I can communicate confidently.
