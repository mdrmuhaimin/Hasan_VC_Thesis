### 3) Pain inventory by stage and persona

| Stage | Pain (short name) | Description & evidence (keywords) | Severity (1–5) | Frequency (1–5) | Current workaround | Time/Money spent | Emotion | Related H# | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| In-trip | Transport price opacity | Detected terms: taxi | 4 | 5 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Stress | H2,H8 | High |
| In-trip | Train impractical with luggage/kids | Detected terms: train is good but a bit expensive for some people, right? um, so if there is any app where you can book uh, like there are a lot of local um, like a taxi drivers who who would go between makkah and madina but is there, if there is any app where you you can just book them otherwise you have to wait in on the street and then ask for uh, like, like those drivers who want to go to madina. um, yeah so that's pretty much uh, from the transportation side. um, on the actual like rituals i think um, again if we can put all the information in in the app for example uh, i was uh, i found that book that we got from shepherd handy where there they have lot of or most of the duas um, that are mentioned in quran and in hadith, right? so, literally because i don't remember all of these duas but i, when i was uh, because there are so many places where you can you can make dua for a long time and you run out of your duas, right? so, i found that book very handy when i can see all my duas in one place. so, if you can put those duas in in the app and then i can just go through that so i know that i i, i kind of uh, prayed or recited all those duas. so, that will be at least a peace of mind for me that i'm not missing out anything. same thing in in arafah because people run out of duas, right? so, those people will find it very handy when they have all the duas mentioned in quran and also in hadith. so, i was literally taking that book and um, all the time with me. so, if it is in the phone, definitely it will be easier. um, and then uh, just to uh, so one of the solution we are thinking of to help people juggle their memory, we are actually creating like an ai chatbot that will have like a natural conversation with you and it will ask people like what do you want, maybe it will remind you how you want to envision yourself after your death, how you want to see your children | 3 | 1 | Asking locals/agency, ad-hoc tools | Varies | Frustration | H7 | Med |
