# HajjGuide Interview Analysis — 31. Shetu

> Automated first-pass extraction from the transcript below. Pains and hypotheses are heuristic; ambiguous fiqh items are flagged for scholar review.

### 1) Interview metadata
- **Interviewee type:** Pilgrim (first Hajj)
- **Origin market and language(s):** Bangladesh; Bangla (primary)
- **Trip type and timing:** Hajj 2024 season (no prior Umrah mentioned)
- **Group composition:** 13-person sub-group (Masnun Hajj Travels) within a ~60+ master group (tiers incl. Wahid / Zinnurain); mixed fitness levels
- **Tech comfort:** Medium–High (smartphone user; uses YouTube/online training; tried ministry app, stopped due to inaccuracies)
- **Any special needs:** None explicitly; some group members low mobility
- **Interview date/context:** Post-Hajj debrief; zoom/voice call

### 2) Executive summary
- **Top pains:** Price/value opacity due to multi-tier agencies; hotel location further than expected; food delivery disruptions (authority crackdowns); inaccurate government app; coordination while being rushed (airport/haram); SIM-plan confusion; limited digital wayfinding (tents).  
- **Opportunities aligned with HajjGuide:** Package comparison & verifiable inclusions; tent/hotel pin-drop + offline map; group link/locator & “wait vs. move” guidance; curated ritual checklists/duʿā content; SIM/esim planner; affordable food discovery.  
- **Willingness to pay:** Personally cautious; would accept **agency-bundled** app fee (~৳2k–5k) if value is clear (accurate info, curated answers).  
- **Risks/constraints:** Data accuracy kills trust; mapping inside restricted zones; heterogeneous tech literacy; connectivity gaps (SIM timing).  
- **Overall signal strength for PMF:** **Medium–High**

### 4) Jobs-To-Be-Done
- When choosing a package, I want a **transparent comparison** of tiers/inclusions so I don’t overpay for identical service.
- When I arrive/camp, I want **pin-accurate tent/hotel locations** (offline) so I can navigate without paper maps.
- When crowds push me forward, I want **clear “wait vs move” guidance while staying linked to my group**, so we don’t get separated.
- When planning connectivity, I want a **SIM/eSIM planner** matched to my stay length, so I’m not forced offline.
- When performing manāsik, I want **short checklists, rulings, and duʿā** in one place, so I don’t have to hunt across the internet.

### 5) Journey snapshot
- **Pre-trip**
  - *Tasks*: Select agency, pay installments, online study.
  - *Pains*: Tier/price opacity; unclear inclusions.
  - *Workarounds*: Trust agent; YouTube/books.
  - *Opportunities*: Comparison marketplace; inclusion verifier; scholar-reviewed basics.
- **In-trip**
  - *Tasks*: Arrival, hotel check-in, meals, manāsik, ziyarah, tent days.
  - *Pains*: Food supply disruptions; wayfinding; coordination under pressure; SIM confusion; expensive outside food.
  - *Workarounds*: Paper maps; agents hustle; ad-hoc comms.
  - *Opportunities*: Offline map + tent pins; group link; food discovery; SIM advisor.
- **Post-trip**
  - *Tasks*: Maintain habits, share feedback.
  - *Pains*: Spiritual drift; mixed value perception.
  - *Opportunities*: Gentle habit scaffolding (opt-in), agency feedback loop, referrals contingent on value.

### 6) Alternatives and workarounds
- **Tools referenced**: Ministry Hajj app (inaccurate), Nusuk (appointments/times), YouTube, WhatsApp.
- **Pros**: Familiar; zero-to-low learning curve; abundant content online.
- **Cons**: Inaccurate/fragmented info; paper maps; unreliable coordination; price opacity.

### 7) Willingness to pay and value exchange
- **Explicit price talk**: Would consider **৳2k–5k** if **bundled** by agency **and** delivers clear value (accurate curated answers, checklists, logistics in one place). Personally skeptical of “reminder-only” value.
- **Payer**: Prefer agency-bundled (baked into package). Direct pilgrim pay: **Depends**.
- **Expected ROI**: Avoid overpaying/being lost; reduced stress; faster coordination.

### 8) Hypothesis scoreboard
| Hypothesis (H#) | Support / Contradict / Unclear | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 (Discovery/near-Haram logistics) | Support | Med | Food capacity/price + finding spots |
| H2 (Accessibility marketplace) | Unclear | Low | Wheelchair only mentioned for hauling food |
| H3 (Driver/transport quality) | Partial support | Low–Med | Rude drivers in ziyarah buses |
| H4 (Catering constraints impact UX) | Support | High | Authority blocks; agent scrambling |
| H5 (Gov app trust is fragile) | Support | High | Wrong name/hotel → churn |
| H6 (Group coordination feature) | Support | Med | “Wait vs move” guidance needed |
| H7 (Offline tent/hotel map) | Support | High | Wants Google-map-like pins |
| H8 (Wheelchair price opacity) | Unclear | Low | Not a personal pain point here |
| H9 (Connectivity planner) | Support | High | 30-day SIM vs 40-day stay |
| H10 (Agency pricing opacity) | Support | High | Paid ~7L vs ~5.5–6L, same service |
| H11 (Post-trip habit support) | Support | Med | Motivation fades; reminders alone weak |
| H12 (Curated ritual content) | Support | Med | Checklists/videos useful for many |

### 9) Feature implications and priority
| Feature/Capability | Pain addressed | Module | Must/Should/Could | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Package Compare + Inclusion Verifier | Agency pricing opacity | Marketplace | **Must** | Show tier, hotel radius, meal plan; source-verifiable; delta-price vs peers |
| Tent/Hotel Pin + Offline Map | Wayfinding | AI Concierge/Maps | **Must** | Pin accuracy ≥90%; search by group/tent; works offline |
| Group Link: “Wait or Move?” | Coordination under pressure | AI Concierge/Comm | **Should** | Broadcast guidance; light location sharing; low-connectivity mode |
| SIM/eSIM Planner | Connectivity | Utilities | **Should** | Recommends plan by stay length & KSA rules; supports eSIM/physical |
| Curated Manāsik Checklists + Duʿā | Ritual guidance | Guides | **Should** | Short, scholar-reviewed; Arabic/Bangla; audio |
| Food Finder (budget filter) | Expensive/limited options | Guides/Maps | **Could** | Nearby open venues; price band hints |

### 10) Supply-side insights
- **Agency structure:** Multi-tier stacking (main → sub-agents) dilutes value transparency.
- **Catering:** Tighter authority enforcement increases failure rates for 3rd-party food deliveries.
- **Mapping:** Ministries still issuing paper maps; digital pins not standardized.

### 11) Distribution and partnerships
- **Channels:** Agency bundles (Masnun/Wahid/Zinnurain types), mosque networks, diaspora WhatsApp/FB groups.
- **Messaging:** “Don’t overpay. Don’t get lost. Stay with your group.”
- **Affiliates:** Group leaders/Muallims as referrers if trust maintained.

### 12) Risks, constraints, and compliance notes
- **Data accuracy** is non-negotiable; one wrong hotel pin erodes trust.
- **Mapping/permit** constraints inside Haram/tent zones; align with KSA rules.
- **Heterogeneous literacy:** Some pilgrims need live prompts; tech cannot fully replace humans (yet).
- **Privacy:** Minimal, consented location sharing for group link.

### 13) Quotes repository (verbatim)
- “We paid **~7 lakh** while others paid **5.5–6 lakh**—**same** service.”  
- “Ministry gave **paper maps**; if tents were on **Google Maps**, it’d help.”  
- “Authorities were **blocking catering**—license, jamāʿah time… food came and **went back**.”  
- “Food courts were **very expensive** (~**4×** Bangladesh).”  
- “The **Hajj app** showed the **wrong name/hotel**—we stopped using it.”  
- “At the airport they push ‘move forward’; we want to **stay together**—an app could guide whether to **wait or go**.”  
- “**30-day SIM** vs **40-day stay**—some people stayed **offline**.”  
- “Spiritual uplift faded… **reminders alone** may not help everyone.”

### 14) Contradictions, unknowns, follow-ups
- Exact dates, package inclusions, and contract wording for the 7L price.  
- Quantify average walk distance from hotel to Haram per prayer.  
- Validate food-court price bands by area/time.  
- Map pin precision needed (tent block, street, entrance?).  
- How many in the group were offline, and impact on safety/coordination.

### 15) Recommended next experiments
- **E1:** *CompareView* MVP: scrape/verify 20 Bangladesh-origin agency packages; A/B pricing transparency copy → CTR & trust lift.  
- **E2:** *TentPin* pilot: crowdsource + verify 100 tent/hotel pins; offline tiles; task success ≥90% in hallway tests.  
- **E3:** *GroupLink* beta: low-bandwidth “wait/move” broadcast + QR room/tent code; separation incidents ↓ by 50%.  
- **E4:** *SIM Planner* checklist: recommend plans for 30–45 day stays; adoption ≥60% among testers.
