Name: Munshi Md. Ashfaqul Alam

Role: Operations Director – Hajj & Umrah Agency

Location: Bangladesh

Age Group: 40–50 (estimated)

Pilgrimage Type (served): Hajj & Umrah packages

Business Stage: Small agency, launching full operations next year

Focus Market: Premium pilgrims only — avoids low-budget segments

Interviewer: Muhammad

Journey / Context
Growth Model:

100% referral-based through personal network, Facebook, and WhatsApp

No paid marketing; scaling via sales associates, each managing a small group of pilgrims

Branding Approach:

Operates under own brand, but open to sub-brands for specific markets

Trust built via Makkah-based reps, known hotel/transport providers, and personal relationships

Service Model (4-Step Workflow):

Ticketing: Purchases through IATA members

Hotel Rooms: Secured via local Makkah agents for better rates

Food: Optional catering arranged per group needs

Taxi/Ziyarah: Optional, using trusted personal drivers

B2B Activity:

Sells packages to other agents in addition to direct clients

Payment Flexibility:

Can facilitate payments from Bangladesh to Saudi as an alternative to remittance

Pain Points / Challenges
Transport delays: Peak-season jams; buses/taxis sometimes fail to arrive

Referral scaling limit: Growth tied to slow-expanding personal network

No associate tracking: Multiple sales associates managed without any tracking tool

Missed tech opportunities: Strong reluctance to explore tools unless they solve a very specific, painful problem without changing workflow

Opportunities / Suggestions
Partnership over product sale:

Open to us joining as sales associates in his system

Willing to let us resell his packages under our own or joint branding

Could provide access to his trusted logistics network if we sell within his model

Quotes & Memorable Statements
“Tech is not needed because referrals keep business flowing.”

“Our network is enough for our scale.”

Other Observations
Relationship-first operator, premium-focused

Prioritizes brand reputation and trust over automation or marketing

Not in “growth mode” — sees value in selective partnerships rather than aggressive expansion
