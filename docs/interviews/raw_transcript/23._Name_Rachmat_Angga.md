🏢 Background Information – Pilgrimage History & Context
Performed Umrah 3 times:

2016 (Dec) – With a travel agency

2023 – Semi-private trip with friends

2024 (Feb) – Fully DIY with family

All trips were outside peak Ramadan and Hajj seasons.

Prefers DIY travel for flexibility, lower cost, and full control.

Prior knowledge of rituals meant he did not need extensive guidance.

🚶 Journey / Context – Planning, Booking & Coordination
Booking Tools:

Flights & Hotels via Traveloka

Train (Makkah–Madinah) via official website

City transport using Careem app

Coordination:

Semi-private trip had an appointed amir.

DIY family trip coordinated entirely via WhatsApp.

No interest in additional coordination tools.

🚧 Pain Points / Challenges
Visa Processing: DIY visa arrangement was stressful and complicated.

Hotel Location Clarity: Accidentally booked a hotel far from Haram due to unclear listing.

Transport Trust Issues: Aware of taxi scams despite using Careem successfully.

Ziyarat Coordination: Skipped Ziyarat due to lack of trusted service providers.

Shopping Experience: Didn’t know what to buy or where to shop.

Video Fatigue: Finds video content inefficient for rituals, prefers concise text guides.

💡 Opportunities / Suggestions
Offline-first ritual guidance app as a modern replacement for printed books.

Integrated, scam-free service bundle including:

Trusted taxis

Guided Ziyarat tours

Local shopping assistance

Hotel listings with clear distance-to-Haram indicators.

Optional paid services for logistics, while keeping ritual guidance free or affordable.

🗣️ Quotes & Memorable Statements
“Videos are too time-consuming. I prefer something I can read and refer to quickly.”

“If I’m going DIY, I only use an agency if the price difference is small enough for the convenience.”

“Offline access is a must — I don’t want to rely on internet during Umrah.”

📌 Other Observations
Strong offline-first requirement — rejects media-heavy apps.

Price-sensitive — unwilling to pay for content-only apps.

Recommends agencies for first-time pilgrims, but insists experienced pilgrims get better value through DIY.

Trust is a major factor — avoids unverified services even if convenient.
