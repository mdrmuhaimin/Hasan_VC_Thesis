### Raw Interview:

ranscript of "Moussa Tarteel Muslim App Insight - Jul 29 2025.mp3"
[00:00] Muhammad: Salamkum Lalamkum. Can you hear me?
[00:02] Muhammad: Mohamad, I can hear you.
[00:03] Muhammad: Okay. So, I think we'll wait for a bit for brother Musa.
[00:06] Muhammad: Hopefully, he will join. I'll he send him a message inshallah.
[00:09] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: [best guess: As-salamu alaykum]. Sorry for the delay on my hand.
[00:15] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Muhammad, how are you?
[00:16] Muhammad: Welcome.
[00:17] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: How are you guys doing?
[00:18] Muhammad: Alhamdulillah. So, I'll do a quick introduction.
[00:20] Muhammad: Brother Musa, you know me very well. Alhamdulillah. We have worked in neighboring uh I think office in community tech. I'd like to introduce you with uh Sister. So I got introduced to her through like the incub like a venture studio program of Hassan VC run by brother Omar Munshi. I think you know brother Omar Munshi right?
[00:33] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Uh yes.
[00:34] Muhammad: Yes. So he started this venture studio program which both of I were part of. So we are trying to create something that will um help a new founder uh like solve some of the challenge and act as an AI co-founder and Brother N, this is Brother Musa, he is the founder of Tartil AI. It's alhamdulillah one of the best uh Quran memorization app. Alhamdulillah, he almost bootstrapped it, started as his personal project, and alhamdulillah, right now it's helping millions of persons worldwide. So Uh, Muhammad, your uh your audio has uh been cut off for me.
[00:54] Muhammad: Mohammed, I think um your audio is not clear. Um I couldn't like hear you for the whole of your of your sentences just now.
[01:01] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: So, Sister Nur, what country are you based out of?
[01:04] Muhammad: Um yeah, right now I'm in base uh I'm based in Malaysia.
[01:07] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Okay, nice.
[01:08] Muhammad: Yeah. Uh and uh yeah, I've joined this venture studio program. Um but uh I actually got to know um brother Muhammad Akar from um because he's from Singapore and I live in [best guess: Johor Bahru]. [best guess: Johor Bahru] is actually just like...
[01:17] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I, I know it. Yeah, I lived in Singapore at one point actually.
[01:21] Muhammad: Oh, you live in Singapore? I see.
[01:22] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: No, not Yeah. Not not right now, but uh I, I lived there in uh 2018 for 4 months.
[01:28] Muhammad: I see. So So you kind of know like Johor is like just a a neighbor of Singapore. So...
[01:32] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah, I took the bus from uh I took the bus from Singapore to [best guess: Kuala Lumpur] one time, for example. So of course we, we passed through uh through Johor Bahru and uh and like, I, you know, I got a little familiar with the geography. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah, you know, quite well.
[01:43] Muhammad: Mohammed, my connection is good. Sorry. I think I was trying to introduce you with brother Musa. So brother Musa and I used to work in the same compound uh in Waterloo. So through that I know him. And brother Musa, I worked with Sister N from [best guess: Hasan VC] Venture Studio and we are trying to build what would be an ideal AI co-founder would be for newly new entrepreneur that would help them some of their main challenge of founding a startup. So this was like originally Sister N's idea. I am helping him as a technical person. So inshallah, I would like to get some insight from you. So Sister N, it's up to you inshallah if you can start the conversation.
[02:10] Muhammad: Sure. Um okay, let me start uh by uh perhaps um asking you to um if you could like introduce yourself and um tell a little bit about your startup journey. How do you started back then from ground zero to something that you have today?
[02:26] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Sure. So um, uh I uh lived in Waterloo and studied at the University of Waterloo. Uh during that time, I was working on a lot of side projects to uh improve my own skill set. Uh and I started work on this uh tool called Ekkra at the time, which later turned into Tartil. And that tool was solving my own problem of being able to search the Quran using your voice. Uh so instead of needing to type, because I, I struggled with like Arabic typing and Arabic keyboard and stuff like this. Um I was like, I should just be able to, you know, uh recite like a word or a few words or something from an ayat that I remember and find it or find all the matches for it and whatnot. So I built that for myself. Uh I ended up kind of evangelizing that work. Uh people were really excited about it and wanted it to then, since it knew what you were reciting, it wanted it to correct your recitation. But the main bottleneck at that point was the accuracy of the speech-to-text technology, and uh the bottleneck was needing our own model that uh would have uh high enough accuracy to actually do correction. So I met a number of different brothers. Uh we all worked on this in different capacities, like an open-source volunteer project, etcetera. And uh the progress was really slow in that capacity. So, um in 2020, uh we made the decision basically to uh uh to like uh some of us, uh like four of us, decide to like work on this as an actual company. So we had the appropriate time and resources allocated to actually see it grow. Uh two of us, including uh myself, uh quit our jobs uh and then started working on it full-time, uh basically from the end of 2020. Uh and then uh the other two uh did the same. Uh so that's kind of uh where we got started. Uh we raised initial seed round from Muslim angel investors, and then we uh grew the company after that bootstrapped. Uh so that's kind of the very quick summary of uh my journey with Tartil.
[04:22] Muhammad: All right. Uh thank you for sharing. Um it was great. Uh perhaps you could tell, during your journey, uh um um since you have raised initial seed round from angel investors, like what are the biggest challenges you face as a founder in the early stages of your startup?
[04:41] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, the biggest challenge you face in the early stage of your startup is not necessarily investment. Investment is something you don't necessarily need, depending on what you're building.
[04:48] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: The biggest challenge you have is actually proving product-market fit.
[04:52] Muhammad: All right. So can you explain a little bit in terms of the um when you try to prove the product-market fit?
[04:57] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah. So in our case, uh we had very strong signal that there's product-market fit, and our challenge was actually building out the product to match it. Uh and still, until today, that's one of the, we clearly have product-market fit, but there's still some challenges around that, in the sense that um, uh we had many, many people telling us, "We, we want to be able to recite and it correct our mistakes, and this is something we would pay for." Uh so that was like the kind of clear indication that there would be product-market fit if we actually built this. Uh and we had signal that people already paid for uh teachers to listen to their recitation and correct their recitation and things like that. So we had that signal there in terms of the fit. But for us, the challenge was, because it's a very technical product, actually building the technology uh to meet that product-market fit and getting it to a level of fidelity where people are actually comfortable using it and paying for it. So that was like one of the main challenges on our end. But usually, the the the thing is normally you have a hypothesis for something, like you have some understanding that okay, I think this is a problem and I think that if I do this solution, it will solve this problem. You need to actually prove that. Like you need to actually prove that your understanding the problem is correct, and that if you build this solution and it works properly, then people will actually pay for it.
[06:21] Muhammad: So in the case that you've given me here of, "Okay, I want to build something that helps people like found a company as like a kind of like some kind of uh technology-based co-founder," um you need to prove that that's the piece that people are actually struggling with in terms of founding a company and you need to prove that your solution would actually help them get past that point and then you need to prove what would they pay for that. Like, um based on um your product and market fit, right? Uh were there like um early signals from the user or the market that you wish you had taken more seriously?
[06:58] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Um I think in the beginning we built a bunch of stuff that didn't really matter. Like we had some theories about gamification. We kind of did a half-baked attempt to ship that stuff before Ramadan. So that still like lives in the product till today, but it's not very valuable functionality and maybe it wasn't the right area to focus on. Uh so I think that's one of the main lessons I would uh learn from it is that uh uh really focus on just doing one thing very, very well before you build out all this other like fluff, basically, around it that just kind of uh supports it but doesn't really matter. Like nobody is really paying for Tartil for the badges or for the leaderboards or something like this. They're really paying for Tartil for the for their recitation features at this point, primarily. So, uh like that's the main thing. Like if we improve the accuracy of our mistake detection or we build additional experiences around the mistake detection and things like this,
[08:14] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Uh testing experiences or things like this, that's the main area where people actually pay for it. Uh and that's what proves product-market fit.
[08:24] Muhammad: In our operation, do you use any AI tools in your startup?
[08:27] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Sorry, I think your audio has a problem. It's like very muffled for me now.
[08:31] Muhammad: Yeah, N, I think last thing you said is a bit muffled. Can you maybe bring it closer to the mic?
[08:35] Muhammad: Okay. Can you hear me now?
[08:37] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: It's still a bit muffled. It was very clear earlier, but now a bit muffled.
[08:40] Muhammad: Okay. Okay. I was asking like, in, in your operation, um of your internal, internal process, right, do you use any AI tools in your startup? And if yes, what purpose for that, uh the tools?
[08:55] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Uh yeah, we use AI for a bunch of stuff. Like engineers use it for coding. Uh we use it for translation, uh like of UI strings and things like this. Uh we use it for brainstorming. Uh we use it for um, like we're integrating it currently within our customer support flows. Uh, so we're using it across a number of different areas.
[09:12] Muhammad: You can tell the tool that you're using for coding. Can you name it?
[09:16] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Sorry, the audio still isn't that clear from uh my end.
[09:20] Muhammad: Oh, okay. Muhammad, can you like take over for us and I will, I'll try to fix this.
[09:25] Muhammad: Okay. So, for example, uh, brother Musa, so if you are talking about the AI tool that you use, what are some of the main uh AI tools, if you name them, that you use uh right now for your product? So if you give me maybe three top AI tools that you cannot live without.
[09:50] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, like engineers are using Cursor primarily. Uh a lot of team members are using ChatGPT, uh and um, and for AI and things like this, there's a lot of different customer support tools with AI that have come up in the last uh year or six months. So we're still experimenting with those to see what we adopt, but that should make a big difference, and we've already tested some of them. Like Intercom has their own offering, for example, called Fin. Uh there's ParaHelp, there's Chatbase, there's a whole bunch of different ones.
[10:17] Muhammad: So, as you've seen, like uh, as I said earlier, like one of the main challenges for you is to find out, is like the product-market fit, to understand like whether your customer actually like your product, and you had, you said you had some signal, um so...
[10:30] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: It's not about they'll, they like the product. Just to interrupt you there. Like, it's quite important you understand this piece. Product-market fit isn't whether they like the product. It's whether they'll actually like, like, like use the product in the way that you're intending, like whether they'll pay for it. For example, if you're trying to sell a product and they like it, but you need to sell it at $100 and they're only willing to pay 10, then there's no product-market fit. It doesn't matter that they, in theory, they like it.
[10:57] Muhammad: I see what you're saying. So if this product-market fit you want to test it right now, would you do it like same way you do it um back in your Waterloo days or you would have done it differently using AI? And if you differently now, how would you do it now?
[11:13] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Uh yeah, you don't really, like AI is a tool like within different capacities to achieve certain objectives. It's not what builds your product. So I would, like, I would still, if I'm writing code, I would still go back and use Cursor. If Cursor was available five years ago, sure, I'll use Cursor five years ago or 10 years ago or whenever. Like these, these tools aren't building the, like, are supporting me in doing certain tasks. They're not the the basis of the product itself. They're not building the product.
[11:42] Muhammad: I see what you're saying. But uh for understanding uh users' vibe, understanding whether your users actually want to use the product or not, right? For understanding those things, uh would you use any sorts of AI tool? Or say, for example, analyzing how your user responded to something, what sorts of AI tool would you think might be helpful?
[12:00] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, if there's some AI to summarize signals from, if you're able to like uh screen record people's uh sessions on your website or these kind of things like session replays and analyze that stuff, maybe that could be useful to you. But at the end of the day, you need to figure out what are the key metrics that prove that people are actually using your service and sticking around with it, and then you just need to track those. I don't know if AI really is needed in that process.
[12:20] Muhammad: I see. So you think you still want to do it like as you would have done it traditionally? Um that makes sense. So um, excuse me. So uh in terms of um, right now, um, like product management, I think many, many, many times, many of the people, they're suggesting one of the thing that is right now is main bottleneck for tech development is like the product management. So, for example, uh how do you handle like the product management process itself within the organization? Do you use AI or you use like folder systems?
[12:53] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, we just use like uh, like we write up like product specifications and and uh we do user research sessions and and and like these kind of traditional processes. Are we using AI as parts of these things? Sure. So we'll be like using AI to like research certain topics. Like we use ChatGPT to actually look into certain topics and brainstorm like different ways of approaching certain problems or things like this. Uh we'll use, for example, like AI note-takers in our research sessions or things like this to allow the researcher to focus more on the questions they're asking. Like the AI is being used as a tool within these processes, but the processes themselves haven't changed.
[13:46] Muhammad: Um, one of the things you guys have done, especially with Tartil, you like the problems solved, which is like training, training a machine learning model to like understand like the recitation and understand if it is like uh doing it uh correctly from Arabic pronunciation. That was like a very novel problem even back, uh especially back then when the Arabic language model and TTS was not that developed. So how do you guys uh like focus on that and how AI changed your entire research-oriented development focus?
[14:02] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, that process has nothing to do with AI. Like, we're like, aside from the fact that we're producing AI, like training it itself is gathering like data and labeling the data and training the models. So there's no like, there's minimal AI in the AI training process. The AI is the outcome.
[14:18] Muhammad: When it comes to doing like very novel research. Do you think AI help you to understand like the latest paper and latest technology and able to implement the paper itself or like help you uh do more like research-focused engineering work?
[14:30] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah. But this isn't related to like something being novel or not in that regard. Like in any domain, if you're looking to understand some new topic, like AI is just a helpful tool for summarizing, uh for finding appropriate context on the internet. Um like, like there's certain things that it's used for regardless of it's novel research or not. Like if you're trying to learn how to cook something new. You know, you've got a new biryani recipe or you've never made biryani and you, you want to know what are all the different kinds of biryani and how they vary depending on the country and like what are the core ingredients and what are some popular recipes for biryani and all this stuff, like you can use ChatGPT for this. And in the same way, if you're trying to figure out like, okay, what is MCP and like how do I integrate MCP in my products and what is the way of thinking about this and stuff, if you ask the appropriate questions, you can get the, you know, like helpful like learnings and insights from it. So it's, it's like a, it's not specific to novel research or anything like that.
[15:53] Muhammad: I see. Um so one of the, you actually work in a faith-based tech. Like there is a common misconception, or maybe this is true, uh but especially Muslim community, they don't like to spend money when it comes to faith-based product. Rather, they want, they have a notion that, "Okay, Islamic product should be free." So what was your go-to-market strategy for that? And do you feel like Muslim community indeed hold this kind of mentality toward Islamic products?
[16:19] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, the community holds the mentality. I think our company specifically has actually shifted that mentality for some people. We know many of our subscribers are subscribing to Tartil as their first in-app subscription, let alone their first Islamic subscription. Um so definitely like we ourselves have actually led to a shift in terms of that mentality. Uh but um the mentality still holds to a large degree. I see people all the time in social media questioning like subscription costs for this and stuff like that. But the the main thing is you should also like be able to understand like what the key value proposition is uh of like what you've built and and how it compares to something else that people are already paying for. So we don't replace an Imam or a Sheikh or whoever you're like going to recite to, but that person potentially you're already paying them in many contexts. And uh and even whether you are or you aren't, like Tartil is like serving a role, like, you know, you're meeting with them an hour a week, the rest of like the, you know, like uh like 24/7 outside of that hour, Tartil is available for you. So I think it's understanding the positioning and actually having like a a key unique improvement that you're offering. And what we did is we offered a freemium model. So to get people in the door, we offered the the free tier and people can try it and things like that and then we offer free trials. Uh and from there we work on conversion. So uh that's been our approach.
[17:49] Muhammad: I see. I understand. So um, in that case, one thing you earlier said, it's really important for you to focus. But when it comes to Quran recitation, there is 10 right that people recite. And like, for example, somebody who is from um, Nigeria, the way he would recite versus somebody who is from Pakistan, the recitation would be slightly different. So how you manage this focus in terms of correct recitation? So do you uh like target only few um recitation style or that work on all recitation style and how to manage priorities?
[18:23] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: So the style isn't so much of an issue if they're actually reciting correctly. What you want to do is you want to train your model using data from different sources. Should all look the exact same. So you feed in audio from Pakistan, you feed in audio from Nigeria, etcetera. You'll get a model that can deal with the two of them. Uh but there's areas where we don't focus, which is actually like, for example, so we don't support, we don't support [best guess: Qira'at], we don't support anything other than Hafs right now. Eventually, we would like to, when we have the appropriate resources for it. But right now, 90% of the Muslims pretty much are reciting Hafs, uh and especially in many of the countries where people are actually paying for these types of things, they are reciting Hafs. So that's a big enough market to tackle it, to solve for it, to to build a good experience around it. Uh and then inshallah, we can get to the point of supporting other.
[19:30] Muhammad: Can you hear me now?
[19:31] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah, I can hear you. But I think, but I think you got it cut off. Uh so yeah. So anyway, I understand your point. Um, now uh in terms of uh data collection and data privacy, right? So to train a model like this uh properly, like you need a huge volume of data. So as a new startup, what was your strategy to uh as a data-driven startup to collect data so that people trust with you that their data is going to be stored securely and uh nothing is bad is going to happen? So how was your challenge to win the trust and collect the data?
[20:11] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, I think this is a matter of brand to some degree. Like you have to build the appropriate brand around what you're doing so that people have the perception that you will, that you will, uh uh be trustworthy, and then you have to honor that, you have to actually be trustworthy. So it's not like a straightforward thing. Like there's people until today who they still have concerns about their data privacy and data storage and stuff like this, even though we're, you know, like we're an established company to some degree and um, uh and, you know, we're serving millions of people. But the uh like still there's people who have those concerns. So I don't think there's a, it's a zero or one. It's a, "I need a certain amount of data. I need to convince certain quantity of people or I need to find a certain number of sources that are willing to give me that data uh in a way that I can use it basically and establish that trust." That looks different in different domains. And also most AI products right now are not being like fine-tuned on massive amounts of data in an entirely new context, like what we did with Tartil. Like the majority of AI products right now are just wrappers around ChatGPT or things like this. They're really integrating AI within a product experience. So the vast majority of people don't really have this issue in the first place in terms of building up this data set and stuff like this. This is more unique towards uh the specific problem we tackle.
[21:28] Muhammad: Yeah. Uh it's, so I have uh one question regarding that. So I understand that you are using your own proprietary model, but you also say you are kind of bootstrapped. So hosting your own proprietary model, like training like an existing model, it is uh kind of very expensive, um if you have to host it in a way. So how do you uh how challenging was it to manage your server cost, especially when it comes to uh buying GPU and model uh those sorts of things?
[21:58] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: So hosting it for inference, which is actual production use, is not that big of a deal. We managed to figure out over time how to get that cost down. You know, originally it was more expensive than it even is now, because uh like even with a much smaller amount of users, because we hadn't figured out how to optimize some of the things to make the right tradeoffs. So as we had those learnings, those costs went down. Uh but they were, they were substantial costs, and there even now, they're still substantial costs, but it's not anything crazy. The bigger costs actually usually training. How do you like get all the data, manage all the data, train models with this data, etcetera? And the GPU is required for that. That becomes more of a cost. And that's also a challenge. Like early on, we spent some money on GPUs, but we also, uh we also got support from certain key like individuals with access to like compute clusters. Uh so we, we had access. Like Stability AI had a compute cluster, like a super cluster, and uh and we were able to actually get free access to that for a period of time in a limited capacity, but we still, that was quite helpful. Um like uh the, there's some of these things alhamdulillah like came and and unblocked us on some of these things. Right now, we have money that we spend on compute, like it's part of our operating costs.
[23:25] Muhammad: I see. Now the question comes to AI in terms of religious space, right? So like, like certain things like health, religious, they're very sensitive. So how would you handle like the cost of the mistake? So if I give an example, if I read and memorize Quran through Tartil and I made a mistake, but Tartil is not able to catch that, I continuously reading that mistake and that mistake become ingrained for me. That's kind of become like a challenge for any AI that deals with this sorts of area. So how do you handle the social responsibility of notifying users and um making sure like they're not learning something uh negative uh in terms of uh like using an AI-based tool?
[24:19] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah, the important thing here is the positioning. So I would say like um uh like with Tartil for example, we don't position Tartil as being 100% accurate. You'll never hear us say that. It's not true in the first place. Uh so this is the thing, like you're not supposed to expect that Tartil will never make any mistake or something like that. We don't position it like that. We even explicitly say we don't do tajwid at all. Um that, that's the first thing. The second thing is like the way we position it is as a supplement. So, so you should still, like if you have the ability to work with a teacher, we don't tell you, "Stop working with the teacher." And you start, you also never hear us say that you should continue working with the teacher, like whether it's a [best guess: Qari] or whoever uh is qualified to actually listen to your recitation and correct mistakes and things like this. You should still be working with those types of individuals. But Tartil is a supplement outside of that time that's allowing you to actually catch a percentage of your mistakes that weren't being caught before. So Tartil is positioned as an incremental value add. Previously, you were reciting on your own and nobody was there to listen to you and 0% of your mistakes were caught. Now you're reciting to, let's say it catches 80% or 90% or whatever percentage, even if it was 20%. The point is that 20% is instead of zero. So the thing is you're not using it to replace a process that's at 100% and then you're accountable for the mistakes. Like you're not using it to replace the teacher. You're using it as an additional supplement to substitute for the 0% situation. So that's the main thing. But I see a lot of people trying to do AI Islamic stuff where they want to answer like give like [best guess: fatawa] and and answer like religious questions and stuff like that. Definitely most of those people are going to be held accountable for doing that without the appropriate uh appropriate like uh like uh guidelines and and uh and guardrails and and whatever.
[26:39] Muhammad: I see. Makes sense. So I have my last question to you, then I'll pass it to Sister Nur for conclusion. Like, changing people's mindset. So even back in early 2018, 2019, if somebody tell like this idea that learning Quran or giving uh like reading to a mobile app, that would sound absurd. But right now, alhamdulillah, Tartil is doing very well. There is [best guess: an] Indonesia-based [app] that is doing well. Uh so alhamdulillah this space is developing and you people work a very good job changing people's mindset to trusting a mobile app to do this uh thing. So what was that journey and how is, what is the challenge you face and how you overcome it?
[27:26] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, I think the main thing is like you have to actually build something that works, and then it's, it's a slow, it's a slow challenge. Like many people when they download, they're skeptical of whether it's going to work. I think one of the things that helped us is we actually got in like, there's a period of AI, I think now people are trusting AI again more generally. There was a period where people didn't really trust it. They were pointing out all the mistakes and all the the significant problems with AI, and we, we came before, before all of that. Like we started in a place where AI wasn't really a thing in the first place. So people were very skeptical. If they try it, they have a bad experience, then that skepticism grows. If they try it and they have a good experience, then like, then they're willing to to use it. So I think the thing is it's not like we all of a sudden changed people's mindsets and now everybody trusts, trusts AI, etcetera. Many people don't. But, you know, we haven't captured everyone in the audience. We've only captured a small fraction of the audience. So some people don't trust [best guess: Tartil]. Fine, they don't trust [best guess: Tartil]. But the point is that's not, that doesn't mean you can't build like something just because there are some people who don't trust it.
[28:44] Muhammad: I see what you're saying. So these are all the questions I have, brother Musa. So to you, Sister N, to ask any questions. And...
[28:50] Muhammad: Yeah, I think uh thank you, Mohammed. Um this will be like the last question that we'll be asking. Um so along of your journey uh building Tartil, uh what advice would you give to other um early-stage founders um to be able to like recognize or prevent a similar situation um like you?
[29:08] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah.
[29:10] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I, I think what you need to do is figure out what matters for your solution, uh and figure out how to actually produce it, uh like produce an MVP for that as quickly and early as possible to actually validate what you're doing. So don't think about, "I'm going to like, if I'm building some AI solution and I'm going to collect data for a year and train and get GPUs and spend $500,000 and whatever," and and to just to build something to find out that nobody's going to use it. Like, figure out how to do things. And many other companies have published their own journeys of doing this stuff. Uber is a very famous example of this, for example, where they never built all these algorithms for routing people and stuff originally. You would, like, I think like make their request and and a person was sitting there like matching requests with drivers. Like the person is sitting there manually doing that. That's fine. They prove that at least somebody wants to use this service and then they work on all the scalability and the operations and all this stuff after. But figure out what is the MVP of what you can build to prove in a month or in three months or whatever is necessary in terms of time to actually get that built, like in a relatively quickly, quick period. How do you actually prove that this is uh going to work properly? Um so that, that's the main suggestion I have. Yeah.
[30:29] Muhammad: I think that's very good.
[30:31] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Oh, yeah.
[30:32] Muhammad: Yeah, it's very insightful. Yeah, thank you so much. I think that that will be it. We have come to the end of this interview. Thank you so much uh for spending your time with us and giving insights that will be useful for um this.
[30:45] Muhammad: Thank you, Musa, for your time. I really appreciate you helping us. Uh so um, you already seem like a [best guess: Hajj] app. I have shared with you. I'm actually helping Nur, I'm continue building the [best guess: Hajj] app, but I pivoted uh more into focusing on B2C [best guess: Hajj] packages a bit and on the I also have been. So let's give you an update. Your insight is always very valuable for me particularly. Uh so thank you again for all the support and inshallah, you know, your journey is is exciting and and full of new challenges and and uh and and learnings for you inshallah.
[31:21] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Okay. Thank you very much, brother.
[31:23] Muhammad: Thank you so much.

### Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Mohamed Moussa is the Co-founder and CTO at Tarteel.
• He is focused on "Building the future of Is".
• His company, Tarteel AI, is described as "one of the best Quran memorisation app". It started as his personal project and has since grown to help "millions of persons worldwide".
Journey / Context
• Mohamed Moussa began his journey while studying at the University of Waterloo, working on side projects to improve his skills.
• He started working on a tool called Ekkra, which later became Tarteel.
• The initial tool aimed to solve his own problem: searching the Quran using voice, as he struggled with Arabic typing and keyboards.
• People were excited about the voice search feature and wanted it to correct recitation, which became a new challenge due to the need for highly accurate speech-to-text technology.
• Tarteel began as an open-source volunteer project with multiple brothers working on it.
• In 2020, they decided to form an actual company to dedicate appropriate time and resources to its growth.
• Two co-founders, including Mohamed Moussa, quit their jobs to work full-time on Tarteel from the end of 2020.
• They raised an initial seed round from Muslim angel investors and then grew the company through bootstrapping.
• Tarteel operates using a freemium model to get users in the door, offering a free tier and free trials, then working on conversion.
• They initially focused on the Hafs recitation, which is used by approximately 90% of Muslims, especially in countries where people pay for such products, seeing it as a sufficiently large market. They aim to support other Qira'at in the future when resources allow.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Proving product-market fit (PMF) is identified as the biggest challenge in the early stage of a startup, not necessarily investment. PMF is defined as whether users will "actually like, like, like use the product in the way that you're intending," specifically whether they will pay for it at the intended price point.
• For Tarteel, the challenge was building the technology to meet the product-market fit, given it is a very technical product, and achieving a level of fidelity where people are comfortable paying for it.
• User expectations regarding free Islamic products: Mohamed Moussa states that "the community holds the mentality" that Islamic products should be free. He observes people on social media questioning subscription costs for such products.
• Focusing too broadly: In the beginning, Tarteel built "a bunch of stuff that didn't really matter," like gamification features (badges, leaderboards). He suggests a main lesson learned is to "really focus on just doing one thing very, very well before you build out all this other like fluff". Users primarily pay for recitation features and mistake detection accuracy, not gamification.
• Data collection and privacy: As a data-driven startup, winning user trust to collect data securely for model training is a challenge, requiring building a trustworthy brand and honouring that trust. Some users still have concerns even with an established company serving millions.
• High costs of AI training: While hosting for inference (production use) can be optimised, the bigger costs are usually training, which involves gathering, managing, and labelling massive amounts of data, and requires GPUs.
• Social responsibility and handling mistakes in sensitive areas (e.g., religious learning): There's a challenge to manage the "cost of the mistake" if an AI tool for Quran recitation, like Tarteel, fails to catch errors, potentially leading to ingrained incorrect learning. Mohammad Moussa emphasizes positioning the product carefully. He warns against AI Islamic products that attempt to give fatawa or answer religious questions without appropriate guidelines and guardrails.
• Changing people's mindset and trust in mobile apps for religious learning: Initially, the idea of learning Quran through a mobile app sounded "absurd". Overcoming skepticism requires building something that actually works. Trust is built slowly, and while some people remain skeptical, it doesn't mean a product can't succeed.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Optimise for shareable experiences: For growth, he suggests creating shareable content that includes branding/attribution. For example, offering to generate du'a as an image carousel or single image for direct sharing to Instagram, with a logo and shortlink.
• Creative attractive video content: Come up with relevant real-world situations where the product (e.g., QaniTeen) is obviously useful and create video content demonstrating its use. An example for QaniTeen is promoting having personal du'a prepared during Ramadan for qiyam.
• Focus on Organic Growth Levers: These are identified as having the "highest impact when it comes to marketing if well executed".
• Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly: For early-stage founders, the advice is to "figure out what matters for your solution, and figure out how to actually produce it, like produce an MVP for that as quickly and early as possible to actually validate what you're doing". This helps avoid spending significant resources before proving user demand (e.g., not collecting data for a year and spending $500,000 before validating).
• Use AI as a tool within processes, not the basis of the product itself: AI tools are valuable for various internal operations like coding (e.g., Cursor), translation of UI strings, brainstorming (e.g., ChatGPT), and customer support flows (e.g., Intercom's Fin, ParaHelp, Chatbase). However, "AI is a tool like within different capacities to achieve certain objectives. It's not what builds your product.". Traditional product management processes (e.g., writing specifications, user research) still apply, with AI used as a helpful tool for research, brainstorming, or note-taking within these processes.
• Strategic Positioning for AI in sensitive domains: For products like Tarteel, positioning is key. Do not claim 100% accuracy. Instead, position the AI tool as a supplement to traditional methods (e.g., working with a teacher), not a replacement. Emphasize incremental value (e.g., Tarteel catches a percentage of mistakes that wouldn't have been caught otherwise, replacing a 0% correction situation).
• Train models with diverse data: To handle variations in recitation (e.g., from Nigeria vs. Pakistan), models should be trained using data from different sources.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "The du'a it produced was good and relevant".
• "It asked me if I want an audio version or pdf of the du'a to keep with me which was helpful".
• "It prioritized providing Arabic through transliteration most of the time, which I actually struggle to read. I would've preferred it ask or default to Arabic letters".
• "I asked it for the pdf and it said it generated it but when I clicked on the link to download I get an error. Same thing happened with the audio".
• "Organic growth levers are the highest impact when it comes to marketing if well executed".
• "Come up with relevant real-world situations in which this GPT is obviously and widely useful and then creative attractive video content about those situations that demonstrates using QaniTeen in that situation".
• "The biggest challenge you have is actually proving product-market fit".
• "Product-market fit isn't whether they like the product. It's whether they'll actually like, like, like use the product in the way that you're intending, like whether they'll pay for it.".
• "AI is a tool like within different capacities to achieve certain objectives. It's not what builds your product.".
• "The processes themselves haven't changed." (referring to product management processes despite AI tool usage).
• "There's minimal AI in the AI training process. The AI is the outcome.".
• "AI is just a helpful tool for summarizing, for finding appropriate context on the internet.".
• "The community holds the mentality [that Islamic products should be free].".
• "Our company specifically has actually shifted that mentality for some people.".
• "We don't position Tartil as being 100% accurate. You'll never hear us say that.".
• "Tartil is positioned as an incremental value add.".
• "You have to actually build something that works, and then it's, it's a slow, it's a slow challenge.".
• "Figure out what is the MVP of what you can build to prove in a month or in three months or whatever is necessary in terms of time to actually get that built, like in a relatively quickly, quick period. How do you actually prove that this is uh going to work properly?".
Other Observations
• Mohamed Moussa is available to re-test the QaniTeen app once asset generation (PDF/audio) is working.
• Tarteel has led a shift in mentality, with many subscribers making Tarteel their first in-app subscription, even their first Islamic subscription.
• Tarteel does not support tajwid (rules of Quranic recitation) at all, focusing on basic recitation correction.
• They advocate for supplementing traditional learning (e.g., with a teacher) with AI tools rather than replacing it.
• The trust in AI generally has varied, with Tarteel starting before a period of widespread skepticism and now experiencing renewed trust.
• The concept of bootstrapping and seeking support from individuals with access to compute clusters (like Stability AI) for expensive AI training costs is a notable strategy.
