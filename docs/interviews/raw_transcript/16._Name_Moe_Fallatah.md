I did my undergraduate and masters from uh Ontario and Vancouver, Canada. And after afterwards I right now I moved to Bangladesh to stay with my parents and recently I'm working with a Malaysian venture capital u like studio uh uh firm. So the I'm doing like a short research with them focusing on identifying uh challenge like various uh stakeholder field in the Hajj and Umrah sector. So that's basically core of the meeting. So I have seen alhamdulillah you are working as a senior business uh specialist in the uh group. So I think this is uh a very good opportunity for me alhamdulillah to talk with you and get insight from you to understand um how uh like a reputed hotel chain like operates um what are some of the challenge that you face and how you think uh technology can make it better for everyone basically that's the purpose in also also for the sake of research brother if it is okay if I record this meeting uh then that would be very helpful inshallah can I do that?
Moe Fallatah: Okay, it's fine. Okay. Inshallah brother. So inshallah brother why don't we um I already know alhamdulillah your brother Muhammad fa um falat and alhamdulillah you work as in love group. Uh would you like to share a bit more about yourself or do you think that's enough?
Moe Fallatah: Uh no it's fine no problem. My name is Muhammad Fata. Uh have graduated from New York University in the major of computer engineering technology. I started my war career in uh 2018. It's been now almost seven years. Uh as you know that I'm working with love group as a senior business application. Uh it's mostly it's application related that application to enhance the business and enhance the operation for the for the for internally.
Muhammad: I see. I see. Mah that's It's really good. Alhamdulillah. So brother can you maybe share a bit like how um like group AOR group or any other big hotel chain or or medium level hotel chain operate in Saudi Arabia because in Saudi Arabia there are it's not like other part where like they directly share their hotel through a GDS platform. There are nusukis available there is makam which is like government portal is available also people like to buy uh like hotel and everything directly from them. So what is the scenario like how it actually operates?
Moe Fallatah: Uh actually we are about uh we have two business line. First business line which is travel that is related to booking and make the reservations and buying tickets for our customers. And the other part which is hospitality we have about 10 uh or nine hotels uh around uh all over Saudi Arabia between Mecca and Medina and Riyad. Uh we have four hotels in Mecca and we have another three or four hotels also in Medina and Jeda as well. We do have also two hotels in Jedda. So our business is has two different parts as I told you which is hospitality and travel. uh and the travel agency. The travel agency is always the mostly uh is uh uh operation is mostly with uh making booking for our customers and uh uh buying tickets as well. We have uh contracts with some agencies. Uh this is about the travel and about the hospitality that we are uh uh have guests from all over the world that comes to our uh hotels and stay and spend their joyful time with us.
Muhammad: Mah that's very good. So in both hospitality and travel business what are some of the major challenges that you feel?
Moe Fallatah: Uh I believe it in this kind of business the most important is how to trans your customer, how to make them back to you, how to make them your uh your like your best place to stay or your best uh place of service. So these are the challenges uh challenges that we are facing uh here in our business for us as a corporate office that we are supporting these uh hotels and make sure they are uh they are having the best type of business which is uh in my in my field that is re that is re relevant to applications business wise and in travel also we do have some applications that also reent our business uh business uh business line and we support this type of uh of business I see.
Muhammad: So brother in terms of customer satisfiability so what are some of the challenge you face like how like is it related to um ensuring c like the customer is uh given like the service they are promised is it more related to staff management or is it more related to uh like selling through the right channel?
Moe Fallatah: Uh it has many it has many different effects in if it is something that related to our customers and also as well for the employees that are in our company. Uh like what are the how how much the skills they have, how much knowledge they know about the business and how much they can attract the customers to be our usual customers. Like I like he comes to us every time and he enjoy his time and stay with us or also he like he always choose enough services with uh that is for booking or preparing their tickets or preparing their any reservations that matters.
Muhammad: I see. So brother in terms of booking um I alhamdulillah I myself stayed at Ilafinda Hotel in Makkah. The service was very good. Alhamdulillah and there was also like the survey that was given But the way I booked this ticket using a third party portal like booking.com or aoda and I have seen uh like this um rooms they are sold on various tech channel like sometimes people directly go to the hotel uh room they buy this room and sometimes they um went they sell using uh travel travel portal and also sometimes they are being sold uh using directly from channel. So what are the variation of distribution uh channel overall in uh for Hajj and Umra uh hotels and uh how you ensure that the customer is getting like a better price uh for the hotel?
Moe Fallatah: Uh for the pricing and these things we have uh departments that it fully and focused on the reservations and the surfaces. So these these departments are focusing on uh on the price and for focusing on the services as much as you are giving a good services and you are giving uh a price that is uh come uh come uh come uh competitive with other other uh other uh like other other companies that they are they are in in the business with us they will be happy with that.
Muhammad: I see I see what you're saying. Now like from the research that we are conducting one of the things we have find like the the way this hotel are distributed they gone through like a layer of uh agents. So first maybe like the like the core hotel they sell it to one party that party sell it to another party and the third may sell it to customer. So due to this uh layered uh network sometimes when the customer actual customer who is doing hajan umra they receive the hotel they can sometimes pay up to 50% more than what the hotel is actually uh receiving. So for example if a hotel love group selling a hotel room for $100 like customer they ended up paying maybe $150 and this big am amount of money that this $50 um pricing is going to a third party or middleman that is becoming uh have like two challenge. One it is making hotel room more expensive for customer and also like enough is getting a lower price than what customer is actually paying. So what are the steps and strategies do you think uh people can take to mitigate this big pricing gap or Is it possible for end user who are directly coming from Hajan Umrah directly buy from Ilaf in a much cheaper rate?
Moe Fallatah: Uh for us to overcome this this type of differences and this type of challenges that we are always focusing on our uh on our prices on our prices and our contracts with these agencies to try try to make it match with our internal uh reservation office. So most of our customers are getting directly to us through phone or through email or uh uh through the elab website. We have the marketing team as well as they are working on that. So this is the only way I believe that we are uh we are uh we are handling this type of issues.
Muhammad: I see. I see. And for agency how agencies are getting hotel from you. So for example, there are two
Moe Fallatah: uh we do have uh can you continue please? Sorry.
Muhammad: Yeah. So there are two type of agencies that one is more like smaller agencies like for example they like they organize group travel. So for example Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan all of these places there are people they bring a big amount of group towards uh this hotel. On the on the other hand uh there is also um um what is this thing called uh like website like booking.com and uh like agoda they sell this hotel so how this different channel different party get the hotel from you?
Moe Fallatah: Uh I believe it's through the venue and the the res uh reservations uh department who are uh who are very very strict about the prices processing. Even with these agencies, we have contracts. We are we are we have a limit of uh we have a limit of uh limit of prices that it's uh not not touchable. We are able to gain a revenue from being an agency contracting with us but we cannot like uh go beyond uh and above of our uh standards our standard price.
Muhammad: I see I see that makes perfect sense. So brother I think some of the research that um questions I have that is more focused on with the distribution channel uh distribution channel then like how they are being uh distributed and so in that regard do you think it would be possible for you to connect me with someone uh in the reservation side who can help me on that aspect of the research?
Moe Fallatah: Uh honestly I cannot promise you but I'll try my best to to get it uh done for you. Just give me a few days to contact them and see how to uh like how to manage this.
Muhammad: Okay but inshallah that would be really really helpful. And lastly for customer satisfaction. So for example if I come to hotel through agodora.com or booking.com or or like a travel agency. How you make sure that next time if I come to Makka or Modina I also stayed in aaf hotel like what are some of the channel you use? How you make sure a customer who come to hotel he doesn't lose the leads or offer that is available is there any channel right now?
Moe Fallatah: Uh I believe by covering every need that customer would need with uh in the trans transportations, in the food and beverages, even the room, giving them off better offers and discount. Uh make them happy as much as we can in with the hard welcoming, being kind. All of these uh all of these things will give a good affection on any customer.
Muhammad: Yes, inshallah. And last topic brother I have is business expansion and scalability. Lots of the people right now is want to come uh to do Haj and Umra comfortably and they want like better service uh with a fair price and I think a company like can make a huge contribution in here. So uh howaf is strategizing like making their presence known in not America then Europe and then countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia. So people in those countries they know about um enough hotel they can directly book with them and they can get like a better service. So they focus more on their worship and this logistics have been taken by your hospitality team. So how you doing this business outreach and business scaling and what are the challenge you are facing regarding this?
Moe Fallatah: uh in this kind of businesses? I believe it's The biggest challenge is how to keep your your your reput reputation high. You have a high volume. There is many uh organizations that provide hospitality and provide travel services but it's the most difficult is how to keep your reputation uh always high. How to keep your customers uh always happy uh like customers is it's uh the customers demand it's very easy to know and get and as much as you coverage this this demand uh they will be happy and they they return to you uh marketing team are doing incredible job to uh to make us and to keep our repetition in always in a high in a high lines. Uh they uh even with the survey that and feedbacks from customers and what they're missing what they're missing during their stay and what during their needs. So it will be uh it will be in the next time it will be provided. We are always aiming to enhance our business, enhance the services and make our customers happy. I see.
Muhammad: So for example, reputable travel agencies or online portal uh like in Muslim countries if they if they want to support the Muslim community uh by sending them to hotel, how can they create a partnership uh with companies like ILAF?
Moe Fallatah: Uh this is mostly related to the business development department. They have their uh Now we are in we are in business for almost more than 30 35 years with the enhancement with the development we have we are we are opening new hotels we are renewing some of our old hotels and uh by getting communicating uh and communicate with these agencies in uh like aboard it it it always will help us I believe and they are always open for for new people, for new agencies, they are welcoming uh they are even if you sit a new meeting, even if you sit a new meeting with the VP of the business development, he will be always uh open to have these meetings and open talks and tell uh tell them about and what is it.
Muhammad: Okay brother, so I think brother it would be really helpful inshallah if you can connect me with someone from business development as well and also there is a ervation process as well. So I can gather this information and share it with other people. So inshallah people will know the good work Ilaf group is doing and also it will help expand um's uh business and also people from various parts of the world they can directly reserve uh with group inshallah. So brother it would be really helpful if you can connect me with some executive from these two department inshallah so I can interview them as well.
Moe Fallatah: Okay. Fantastic. Fantastic. Clear.
Muhammad: Okay brother inshallah. So that's all for me. Inshallah. So I will share like a short summary of what we discuss uh with you in your LinkedIn and inshallah if you can uh provide me contact of your business development and research team. I think that would be very helpful. Inshallah.

He is a Senior Business Application specialist with Ilaf Group, where his role primarily involves enhancing business and internal operations through applications.
• Ilaf Group's Business Structure: Operates with two main business lines:
    ◦ Travel: Focuses on booking, making reservations, and purchasing tickets for customers.
    ◦ Hospitality: Manages nine or ten hotels across Saudi Arabia, including four in Mecca, three or four in Medina, and two in Jeddah. These hotels host guests from around the world.
• Moe Fallatah's Role in Operations: Supports Ilaf's hotels by ensuring optimal business performance, particularly in areas related to business applications for both hospitality and travel lines.
Journey / Context
• Muhammad's Research Objective: To gain insights into the operations of a reputable hotel chain like Ilaf, understand the challenges they face, and explore how technology can improve services for everyone in the Hajj and Umrah sector.
• Hotel Operating Environment in Saudi Arabia: Unlike other regions where hotels might directly share through Global Distribution Systems (GDS), Saudi Arabia has specific portals like Nusuk and Makam (government portals). Additionally, customers often prefer to book directly with hotels.
• Customer Booking Channels: Muhammad notes that rooms are sold through diverse channels, including direct hotel bookings, third-party portals (e.g., Booking.com, Agoda), and travel agencies.
• Pricing Management: Ilaf Group has dedicated departments for reservations and services that focus on pricing to ensure competitiveness and customer satisfaction through good service delivery.
• Strategies for Mitigating Pricing Gaps: To address issues arising from layered distribution networks (where customers might pay significantly more than the hotel receives), Ilaf focuses on aligning their prices and contracts with agencies to match their internal reservation office rates. They actively encourage direct bookings via phone, email, or the Ilaf website, supported by their marketing team.
• Agency Partnerships: Ilaf maintains strict pricing policies and limits within their contracts with agencies to ensure standards are met while still allowing agencies to generate revenue.
• Customer Retention Efforts: Key strategies include addressing all customer needs such as transportation, food and beverages, room quality, offering better deals and discounts, providing a warm welcome, and being kind.
• Business Expansion and Scalability: Ilaf's strategy involves maintaining a high reputation, continuously enhancing business and services, and satisfying customer demands. The marketing team plays a crucial role in maintaining their reputation, and customer feedback from surveys is used for continuous improvement.
• Partnership for Business Development: The business development department is responsible for establishing partnerships. Ilaf, having been in business for 30-35 years, is open to collaborating with new agencies and even meeting with the VP of business development.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Earning Customer Loyalty: A major challenge is building customer trust, ensuring repeat business, and becoming their preferred service provider or place of stay.
• Customer Satisfaction Aspects: Challenges include ensuring customers receive the promised service, effective staff management (skills and knowledge), and optimizing sales through appropriate channels.
• Distribution Channel Pricing Discrepancy: A significant challenge is the "layered network" of agents, where end customers for Hajj and Umrah can end up paying up to 50% more than the hotel's actual receiving price. This makes hotel rooms more expensive for customers and reduces Ilaf's revenue.
• Maintaining Reputation and Meeting Demand: The biggest challenge in business expansion and scalability is keeping the company's reputation high amidst numerous competitors. It also involves continuously meeting evolving customer demands.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Direct Booking & Competitive Pricing: Encourage direct bookings via Ilaf's own channels (phone, email, website) and ensure agency contracts are aligned with internal pricing to reduce the price gap for end-users.
• Comprehensive Customer Service: Providing a wide range of services, including transportation, food and beverages, and comfortable rooms, along with offers and discounts, can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
• Leveraging Customer Feedback: Utilizing customer surveys and feedback helps identify areas for improvement and ensures services are continuously enhanced to meet customer needs.
• Strategic Partnerships: Companies like Ilaf are open to creating partnerships with reputable travel agencies and online portals, especially in Muslim countries, through their business development department, to support the Muslim community and expand reach.
