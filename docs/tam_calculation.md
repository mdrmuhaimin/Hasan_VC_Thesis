# Total Addressable Market (TAM) Analysis: The Digital Pilgrim Economy (2024)

A bottom-up market model quantifying the platform's revenue opportunity within the Umrah and Hajj ecosystem. This analysis uses a 2024 baseline, transparent assumptions, and verifiable third-party data.

## Executive Summary: The $1.46B Opportunity

Our Total Addressable Market (TAM) for 2024 is $1.46 billion in potential platform revenue, with a projected range of $0.69B to $2.69B. This market is segmented into two core pilgrimages: the year-round Umrah ($1.10B TAM) and the annual Hajj ($0.35B TAM).

Our model is built on the official number of international pilgrims and identifies four distinct, non-overlapping revenue streams:

- S1: Local Services Marketplace: Commission on services like transport and tours for independent travelers.
- S2: Agency Package Referrals: A referral fee for connecting pilgrims to licensed travel agencies.
- S3: Online Travel Agency (OTA): Commission on direct bookings of hotels and flights.
- S4: Annual Digital Subscription: A recurring fee for a premium suite of digital tools for all pilgrims, establishing a durable revenue relationship.

This bottom-up analysis demonstrates a clear, quantifiable opportunity to build a category-defining platform at the intersection of faith, travel, and technology.

## PART A — UMRAH TAM (2024 BASELINE)

### TL;DR

- UMRAH_TAM (Base, platform revenue) = $1.10B  
- Low ≈ $0.48B · High ≈ $2.03B.  
- Drivers: 16.80M foreign Umrah performers in 2024 (GASTAT via Argaam) [1].
- Strategy: We monetize two distinct cohorts:
  - DIY (Do-It-Yourself) Pilgrims: Via our S3 (hotels & air) and S1 (local services) marketplaces.
  - Agency-led Pilgrims: Via S2 (package referrals).
  - All Pilgrims: Via our S4 (annual digital subscription).

### Guiding Principles: Sourced Data vs. Modeled Assumptions

We anchor our model in verifiable data and clearly state our assumptions for transparency.

- Sourced anchors
  - Total Foreign Umrah Pilgrims (2024): 16.80M (Source: GASTAT, via Argaam) [1].
  - Hotel Booking Commission (Proxy): 14.3%, based on Booking Holdings' 2024 public filings[2], [3].
  - OTA Revenue Mix: Lodging accounts for the vast majority of OTA revenue (~80% at Expedia Group), validating our focus. Air travel is a lower-margin service [4], [5].
  - Local Service Pricing: Anchored to publicly listed prices for transport, tours(airport transfer, Makkah–Madinah transfer, private ziyarah), and eSIMs in Saudi Arabia.[6],[7],[8],[9],[10].
- Key Assumptions (With Low/High Bands for Sensitivity)
  - DIY vs. Agency split (Base 40/60; bands modeled at 30/40/50% DIY; interviews suggest broader 20–80% envelope).
  - ADR/LOS, attach % for hotel/air; Umrah package avg ($2,000) and referral %.
  - Air take-rate = 2% (sensitivity 1–3%).
  - Subscription Monetization: A $10 annual subscription fee, with a de-duplication factor of 0.85 to estimate unique subscribers from the total pilgrim count.

### Inputs (Base unless noted)

#### 1. Pilgrim Segmentation

- Foreign Umrah performers (2024) = 16.80M [1].
- Cohorts: Agency 60%, DIY 40% (primary interviews; bands modeled at 30/40/50 DIY).
  - Agency Cohort (60%): 10.08M users
  - DIY Cohort (40%): 6.72M users

#### 2. S3: DIY Hotels & Flights (OTA Revenue)

- Hotel Revenue per DIY User: Platform commission from a typical hotel booking.
  - (ADR $80 × LOS 6 nights × Take-Rate 14.3%) × Attach Rate 80% = $54.91 [2], [3].
- Air Revenue per DIY User: Commission from a typical flight booking.
  - (Avg. Fare $700 × Take-Rate 2%) × Attach Rate 50% = $7.00
- Total S3 TAM: 6.72M users × ($54.91 + $7.00) = $416.05M

#### 3. S1: DIY Local Services Marketplace (Unbundled Revenue)

- S1: DIY Local Services Marketplace (Unbundled Revenue)
Platform commission on high-demand local services. [6–9]

| Service | Attach Rate | Avg. Price | Commission | Revenue per DIY User |

| **Total Revenue per DIY User** | | | | **$20.76** |
| **Total S1 TAM** | | | | **$139.51M** |

#### 4. S2: Umrah Agency Referrals

- Total S2 TAM: 10.08M Agency users × Avg. Package Price $2,000 × Referral Fee 2% = $403.20M

#### 5. S4: Annual Digital Subscription (Umrah)

- Unique Umrah Subscribers: 16.80M pilgrims × Unique Factor **0.85** = **14.28M**
- **Total S4 TAM (Umrah):** 14.28M subscribers × **$10** annual fee = **$142.80M**

#### 6. Total Umrah TAM (2024)

- **UMRAH TAM = S1 + S3 + S2 + S4 =** $139.51M + $416.05M + $403.20M + $142.80M = **$1,101.56M ≈ $1.10B**
- **DIY-only TAM = S1 + S3 + S4 =** $139.51M + $416.05M + $142.80M = $698.36M

## PART B — HAJJ TAM (2024 BASELINE)

### Key Figures

- **Total Hajj TAM (Platform Revenue):** **$354.5 Million**
- **Range:** Low **$206.6M** / High **$660.5M**
- **Core Driver:** **1.61 million** foreign pilgrims performing Hajj in 2024.
- **Strategy:** Due to the regulated, package-based nature of Hajj, our initial TAM is focused on **S2 (Agency Referrals)** and **S4 (Annual Subscription)** only.

#### Bands (S2 only)

- Low: 1,611,310 × $6,400 × 2% = $206.25M  
- Base: 1,611,310 × $7,000 × 3% = $338.38M  
- High: 1,611,310 × $10,200 × 4% = $657.41M

### Inputs & Calculations (Base Case)

- **Foreign Hajj Pilgrims (2024):** **1,611,310** (Source: GASTAT) [11].
- **S2 (Hajj Referrals):** Avg. Package Price **$7,000**; Referral Fee **3%**.
- **S4 (Hajj Subscription):** **$10** annual fee per unique foreign Hajj pilgrim.

1. **S2 TAM (Hajj):** 1.61M pilgrims × $7,000 × 3% = **$338.38M**
2. **S4 TAM (Hajj):** 1.61M pilgrims × $10 = **$16.11M**
3. **Total Hajj TAM (Base):** $338.38M + $16.11M = **$354.49M**

## No-Double-Count Matrix (by stream × cohort)

| Stream                               | Umrah DIY | Umrah Agency | Hajj |
|--------------------------------------|----------:|-------------:|-----:|
| S1 — Local services                  |         ✔ |            ✖ |    ✖ |
| S2 — Package referrals               |         ✖ |            ✔ |    ✔ |
| S3 — Hotels & flights (OTA-like)     |         ✔ |            ✖ |    ✖ |
| S4 — Paid app (annual, $10/sub/yr)   |         ✔ |            ✔ |    ✔ |

S4 annual subscription is counted once across Umrah + Hajj and reported within Umrah for accounting simplicity.

Licensing note: We do not currently hold KSA travel licensure. Any S3 sales commence only via licensed partners or post-licensure. S3 values represent addressable opportunity, not a go-to-market commitment.

Sourcing hygiene: Where platforms do not publish public commission % (e.g., Viator), we: (i) cite platform pages to establish the commission model, and (ii) cite industry analyses for the typical 20–25% range, clearly marked as directional. Replace with contract terms once available.
