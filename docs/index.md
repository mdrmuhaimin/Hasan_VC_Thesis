# HajjGuide: Venture Studio Thesis

## Executive Summary

We are building HajjGuide, a venture-studio backed platform addressing the **$1.45B** religious tourism technology market. We target the critical post-booking, in-destination gap for 16.8 million annual Umrah pilgrims and 1.6 million Hajj pilgrims.

**The Opportunity:** The in-destination pilgrimage experience remains fragmented, with pilgrims losing hours and money to unverified services, poor guidance, and logistical confusion.

**Our Solution:** We deliver an offline-first ritual companion, licensed service marketplace, and curated exploration platform for the four key pilgrimage cities (Makkah, Madinah, Taif, Jeddah).

**Traction:** We have validated demand through 31 customer interviews, shipped an MVP with 91 total installs (~45 organic) with blended **CPI** ≈ **$0.87** and paid **CPI** ≈ **$1.48**. We have a governance partnership (MoU) in progress with Taibah Institute for content verification.

**The Ask:** We seek pre-seed funding to validate our core hypotheses through controlled market tests while building toward a **$2.32M** serviceable obtainable market in our first 12 months. Use of funds: content governance & scholar reviews, offline Android reliability, concierge ops for liquidity tests, and trip-anchored analytics.
**Licensing note:** No direct Hajj sales; OTA-like flows (S3) will run only via licensed partners or post-licensure.

## SECTION 1: STRATEGIC EXECUTION MODEL

We have identified a critical gap in the $1.45B religious tourism market:
**Selected Approach:** **Hybrid Model** – Rocket Internet rigor on supply onboarding, pricing control, and unit economics, combined with BCGDV Solve Model for high-context, regulated in-destination Umrah workflows.

**Justification:**
We occupy the **post-booking gap** where generic OTAs fail — delivering an offline Ritual Mode, licensed local services marketplace, and curated Ziyarah Explorer for Makkah, Madinah, Taif, and Jeddah.
This hybrid approach leverages proven marketplace and OTA mechanics while solving unique, “hair-on-fire” pilgrimage needs — compliance, offline usability, and high-context guidance.
By focusing on *in-destination service orchestration*, we create an immediate trust moat in a highly regulated, culturally sensitive environment.

### Evaluation Scores

- **Market Timing:** – Umrah volumes are rapidly growing post-pandemic, supported by Saudi Vision 2030’s target of 30 million annual pilgrims ([source][1]). Regulatory enforcement against unlicensed operators is increasing, pushing market demand toward compliant, verified services ([SPA suspension][2], [Gulf News][3]).
- **Team Capability:** – Founder Muhammad Raihan Muhaimin (full-time) brings dual strengths in pilgrimage domain expertise and AI/ML product development. Accelerator and pre-seed support from venture studio adds operational leverage.
- **Resource Requirements:** – Licensing, marketplace build, AI-driven offline companion development, multi-language content, and compliance infrastructure require moderate-to-high upfront investment.
- **Competitive Landscape:** – No dominant, vertically integrated in-destination digital platform exists; competitors are either generic OTAs or fragmented offline operators. Our license-first marketplace and offline mode create strong defensibility.

### Team Commitment Evidence

- Founder: Muhammad Raihan Muhaimin — full-time, background in AI/ML and religious tourism.
- Venture Studio (EIR role) providing structural and funding support for transition to accelerator phase with pre-seed funding upon qualification.

### Scrappy Problem-Solving Examples

- Manually curated flight-visa-hotel Umrah bundles and Hajj Packages for pilgrims via local travel agents; deployed a dua and ritual guidance app that helped pilgrims during Hajj 2024.

### Wedge

DIY Umrah in-destination bundles + offline Ritual Mode + Ziyarah Explorer, trusted and usable without data, with seamless Solo ↔ Hire a Guide handoff.

### Why Now

Rapid market expansion + enforcement-driven shift to licensed operators = timing sweet spot. Generic OTAs are not competing in post-booking, in-destination service orchestration.

### 12-Month “Must Be True” Gates (relative to public beta)

- **Activation:** ≥60% of trip users complete ≥3 meaningful actions in 14 days.
- **Marketplace:** ≥25% of active users buy ≥1 local service; take rate ≥12%; refunds ≤5%.
- **Compliance:** 100% of fulfilled jobs by licensed suppliers; complaints <2/100 orders.
- **Outcome:** ≥70% report ≥5 hours saved or overpayment avoided.
- **Retention:** ≥20% cross-purchase during trip; ≥30% return to Ziyarah Map within trip.

### Guardrails (Day-1)

- Hajj packages only via authorized providers; D2C focus on Umrah and in-destination services.
- PDPL-ready consent logs for location/mic; minimal data collection.
- License-first marketplace (license ID + expiry displayed).

## SECTION 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Industry

Religious Tourism (Hajj/Umrah) and In-Destination Travel Technology.

### Opportunity Description

The global Muslim travel market is projected to exceed **$225B by 2028** ([CrescentRating][17]), with Hajj and Umrah as its most logistically complex and spiritually significant segments. While booking flights and packages has largely digitized, the *in-destination experience* remains fragmented, offline, and dependent on unverified, often overpriced local operators.

### Core Problem

Once in Saudi Arabia, first-time and DIY Umrah travelers face:

- Ritual anxiety from fear of making religious errors.
- Opaque, overpriced local services without license verification.
- Language barriers and cultural friction.
- Crowd and closure uncertainty at key sites.
- Weak discovery of authentic ziyarah locations.
- Risk of getting separated from companions in high-density environments.
Instead of focusing on worship, travelers are forced into constant logistical problem-solving and app juggling.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

DIY and semi-DIY Umrah travelers aged 25–45 from Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and diaspora markets.
Characteristics:

- App-native and comfortable with digital tools.
- Booking flights/hotels via mainstream OTAs.
- Coordinating trips via WhatsApp and social groups.
- Seeking offline ritual guidance, licensed service providers, and trustworthy exploration.

### Why Incumbents Don’t Win

- OTAs optimize for pre-trip cart conversion, not in-trip decision-making.
- Pilgrimage decisions are dynamic, context-specific, and fiqh-aware — requiring real-time, personalized guidance.
- Official channels are essential for permits and inventory, but not designed for concierge-level personalization or hybrid Solo ↔ Hire service models.

### "Hair-on-Fire" Evidence

| Evidence                                                                                                 | Impact on Pilgrims                                        | Source                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Seven Umrah companies suspended (Jun 17 2024)** for failing transport commitments                      | Travellers stranded; ministry had to arrange alternatives | ([Saudi Press Agency][2]) |
| **Ten travel offices shut (Jul 13 2024)** for running unlicensed Umrah services                          | Bookings voided; deposits at risk                         | ([Gulf News][3])          |
| **Real-world delay:** Malaysian pilgrim waited **2 days under airport canopies** then bought new tickets | Lost 48 h + paid extra airfare                            | ([RSIS International][4]) |

### Quantified Pain

- **Time Loss:** Hours wasted per trip resolving logistics and finding trusted services.
- **Financial Loss:** Overpayment on key services like transport, tours, and mobility aids.
- **Frequency:** Pain recurs every trip; high stakes for first-timers amplify stress and dissatisfaction.

### One-Sentence Pitch (YC Format)

Independent Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia struggle with ritual anxiety, overpriced unverified services, and poor discovery because in-destination support is fragmented and not fiqh-aware.

### C. Pillar Gap: Differentiation Index (from attached analysis)

**Method.** For each competitor in BD/MY/ID and adjacent GCC players, we scored the three pillars on a 1–5 scale: **Ritual Mode**, **Ziyarah Explorer**, **License-First**. The **Differentiation Index** is the average of those three.

- Market baseline (mean / median): **2.26 / 2.33** out of 5.
- No incumbent exceeds **3.67/5** on our pillars (i.e., no one is “excellent” across all three).

#### Top 8 (closest to our pillars, ↑ = higher resemblance)

| Rank | Company                        | Differentiation Index |
| ---: | ------------------------------ | :-------------------: |
|    1 | Umrahme (Traveazy Group)       |        **3.67**       |
|    2 | IKHLAS by Capital A (AirAsia)  |        **3.00**       |
|    2 | Umroh.com (Indonesia)          |        **3.00**       |
|    2 | Muslim Pro                     |        **3.00**       |
|    2 | Nusuk (Hajj & Umrah)           |        **3.00**       |
|    6 | Zamzam.com (JV with TBO)       |        **2.67**       |
|    6 | TBO Umrah (TBO Tek Ltd)        |        **2.67**       |
|    8 | Maqam GDS (Official Umrah GDS) |        **2.33**       |
|    8 | tiket.com (with Umroh.com)     |        **2.33**       |
|    8 | Funadiq                        |        **2.33**       |
|    8 | Almosafer (Seera Group)        |        **2.33**       |

**Takeaway.** Even the front-runners are **not** integrating: (1) offline, fiqh-approved **Ritual Mode** + (2) a true **Ziyarah Explorer** + (3) a **license-transparent marketplace** into one in-destination product. That’s our wedge.

---

### D. Regional Battlefield (BD • MY • ID) — Shortlist & where we win

- **ShareTrip / GoZayaan (BD OTAs):** strong pre-trip funnels; **no offline ritual**, **no license-first in-trip orchestration**.
- **AmarSafar (BD B2B2C):** agency rails; lacks **fiqh-aware in-trip UX** and **Ziyarah Explorer**.
- **Umrahme / Zamzam / TBO:** deep supply & accreditation; **generic in-trip UX**; **no integrated offline ritual**
- **Muslim Pro:** huge distribution; Umrah hooks exist; **not** an in-trip, license-badged marketplace; **no offline ritual flow**.

---

### E. What this means for GTM (crisply)

- **Message:** “Only app with scholar-approved **offline Ritual Mode**, a curated **Ziyarah Explorer**, and a **license-first** local services marketplace.”
- **Proof:** Screens + license badges in every listing; mention Taibah governance.
- **Channel:** Imam/mosque cohorts and agency bundles to neutralize OTA scale.
- **Focus SKUs:** Fixed-fare **transport** + **guide** listings with escrow; add tours later.
- **Copy tests:** Feature the three-pillar badges on install/landing (we expect CTR ↑ and CVR ↑ vs generic OTA copy).

---

### F. Risks to monitor (competitive moves)

- **Umrahme/Zamzam** add a lightweight “ritual checklist” and call it done → We still win on **offline + fiqh citation + license transparency**.
- **Nusuk** expands consumer-facing guidance → We partner (rail-compatible) and keep our concierge/marketplace layer.
- **BD/MY OTAs** bolt on white-label guides via WhatsApp → We differentiate on **governance, offline UX, and license-badged marketplace**.

---

### Defensible Edge & Go-to-Market

#### Our Unique Insight

The critical in-destination gap for Umrah pilgrims is not booking transport or hotels — it’s **ritual confidence, trusted licensed services, and contextual exploration** during the trip. No incumbent integrates offline usability, fiqh-verified guidance, and licensed local providers into a single, seamless experience.

#### Competitive Differentiation

- **Offline Ritual Mode** — step-by-step, fiqh-approved guidance without internet dependency.
- **Ziyarah Explorer** — curated 4-city pilgrimage maps (Makkah, Madinah, Taif, Jeddah) with Solo/Hire toggle at every point of interest.
- **License-First Marketplace** — transparent provider credentials, verified compliance, pre-quoted pricing, and integrated reviews.

**Go-to-Market Strategy**
Partner with **licensed local travel agencies** in key origin markets to:

1. Sell their **curated Umrah packages** through our platform.
2. Help them **scale digitally** by enabling full online presence and bookings.
3. Embed **in-destination features** (Ritual Mode, Ziyarah Explorer, license-badged services) as value-add differentiators for their customers.

Initial focus on **Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia**, timed with Ramadan and peak Umrah seasons.

| **Problem Urgency**        |                 **5** | ≥90% independently cited high-stakes frictions affecting worship logistics (permit/route constraints, trusted transport/guide discovery, price opacity).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Problem Frequency**      |                 **5** | Issues recur across stages (airport arrival, intra-city moves, ziyarah, meal logistics); multiple daily touchpoints reported by most users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Willingness to Pay**     |   **4 (provisional)** | Pilgrims already pay via agencies for end-to-end guided Umrah, guided tours, and transport; commissions are standard. Founder has **1 year of paid sales-partner activity** (revealed WTP). Early reads: **Agency bundles** attach \~**1–2% (Lite)** and **4–5% (Premium)**; **Transport** referrals around **20%** feasible; **In-app guidance** WTP **$5–$20** (mode **$10–$15**). |
| **Market Size Validation** |                 **4** | Starting geographies **BD, ID, MY** are among the largest Hajj/Umrah source markets by quota and flow; macro demand supports a sizable reachable SAM with agency-bundled distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Solution Difficulty**    | **4 (scope-bounded)** | App-centric execution promoting **already-registered, licensed providers** (no direct ops). Complexity mitigated via escrow/referral flows, license-first policy, content-led guidance (offline support), and clear dispute/KYC SOPs. Remaining risks: data QA, cross-border refunds/FX, supplier SLAs.                                                                                  |

**Total Validation Score:** **22/25**

### WTP Focus Areas (High → Low)

1. **Agency-based end-to-end guided tour** (agency-bundled upsell with escrow).
2. **Transport** (combined: airport⇄hotel + ziyarah fixed-fare).
3. **Private guide** (substitutable by in-app guidance).
   *(Removed: wheelchair; eSIM deprioritized unless agency-driven.)*

### Monetization Signals (interviews + founder inputs)

- **Agency bundles:** Agencies typically pay **2–5% commission**; many offer **B2B rates** for platform distribution. Founder already monetizes as a **Sales Partner**.
- **Transport:** \~**20% referral fee** norms; B2B rates available (e.g., per supplier interviews).
- **Guidance:** **In-app guidance at $5–$10** one-time (some up to **$20**); **private guides** usually bundled with ziyarah or end-to-end packages.

### Validation Preview (for Section 7)

- **Agency-guided tour (bundled tiers):** Present Lite/Standard/Premium anchored to B2B rates and 2–5% commission norms. **Target:** ≥40% choose any paid tier in interview simulations (or meet channel-benchmark attach if baseline is lower).
- **Transport (fixed-fare bands):** Offer 3 fare bands on common routes + escrow option. **Target:** ≥60% choose a band and accept in-app booking; **Supply-side:** ≥70% of providers consent to the target take-rate (benchmarked to \~20%).
- **Private guide vs in-app:** Side-by-side daily guide fee vs app module at **$5–$10**. **Target:** ≥50% select app-only at these price points.

### Operating Assumptions (to sustain Solution Difficulty = 4/5)

1. **No direct fulfillment** (we list/route; we do not operate transport/tours).
2. **Payments** collected by agency or via a **compliant PSP** (escrow/settlement; KYC/AML handled).
3. **License-first supplier policy** with visible badges and periodic checks.
4. **Disputes & refunds** handled by a documented SOP with response SLAs.
5. **Data QA** pipeline for itinerary/hotel/guidance content with offline fallback.

## SECTION 5 — Hypothesis Mapping

At this pre-seed stage, We draw our hypotheses from 30+ discovery interviews and early MVP deploys (e.g., Hajj-peak test with basic tracker yielding 68 installs). Full quantitative validation awaits funding for analytics. Each includes our belief, test method, and status (validated via interviews, partially validated via deploy, or needs testing).

### **Interview-validated core hypotheses**

| Hypothesis | Why do we believe this? | **How have we validated via interviews (no build)** | Preliminary result | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **H1 — Core pilgrim problem–solution fit** | Recurrent pains: wayfinding, fragmented guidance, price opacity; trust is paramount. | In 31 interviews, **≥90%** described guidance/wayfinding/price issues; multiple pilgrims asked for a single trusted app with **offline “Ritual Mode.”** Founder’s 2024 guide role echoed these gaps. | **Supported.** | When ready: concierge MVP; target **Activation ≥40%**, **2-wk retention ≥30%**, **Net Promoter Score (NPS) ≥40 (post-beta target)**. |
| **H2 — Marketplace liquidity** | Licensed transport/guides exist; discovery—not raw capacity—drives pain. | Provider/buyer interviews (e.g., agency owners; Driver Solaiman) reported capacity, typical response times, and peak patterns; collected **license/permit** statements and SLA promises. | **Provisionally supported.** (No live fill-rate yet.) | Small **concierge fill log** (no app): measure time-to-confirm & cancels across peak windows. |
| **H3 — WTP / take-rate viability** | Pilgrims already pay for agency bundles, tours, transport; guidance WTP **$5–$20** (mode **$10–$15**). Agencies pay **2–5%**; transport referrals \~**20%**. | Buyers (who are also experts) confirmed **commission norms & B2B rates**; multiple users expressed willingness to pay for **in-app guidance**; founder has **paid sales-partner income**. | **Supported (provisional).** | Structure **price-card tallies** (n≥30/SKU) + **provider poll** (n≈15) to lock price points & take-rates. |
| **H4 — Acquisition cost repeatability** | Imam/mosque endorsements, group leaders, agency bundles, diaspora FB/WA groups surfaced as effective. | Interviewees named these as **trusted join paths**; referrer influence noted; we logged **acceptable incentives** qualitatively. | **Qualitatively supported.** | Quantify **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by channel** (Cost Per Install (CPI)\~$1 benchmark); aim **payback <3 months**; keep affiliate CAC as commission. |
| **H5 — Regulatory compliance** | Permit/route enforcement & driver legality are common themes; license-first lowers risk. | Users and providers described **checks, stops, and documentation**; **license badges** perceived as trust-building; comfort with **escrow/KYC** discussed. | **Supported.** | Shortlist **PSP/escrow (TBD)**; draft **license audit** cadence & **<72h** dispute SOP. |
| **H6 — Guidance engine (AI + curated, offline)** | Desire for authoritative, low-distraction answers; strong preference for **scholar-endorsed** content. | Pilgrims reacted positively to the idea of **compiled, concise rulings**; caution on accuracy and screen usage during rituals; acceptance higher with **named scholars**. | **Provisionally supported.** | Build curated Q&A; set **scholar double-review**; later evaluate AI (accuracy ≥90%, harmful=0, CSAT ≥4.3/5). |
| **H7 — Group-aware routing & tent coordination** | Lost/meeting-point confusion is frequent; printed maps are cumbersome. | Multiple pilgrims recounted **tent-finding** and regrouping issues; interest in **meeting-point cards** and simple timed routes; willingness to **share location** in group contexts. | **Supported.** | Pilot GPS group mode later; targets: **ETA error ±15%**, **lost-person ↓50%** vs baseline. |
| **H8 — Trust, safety, dispute resolution** | Fear of overpaying/middlemen; appetite for **fixed fares + escrow** and transparent reviews. | Users preferred **escrowed fixed-fare** over open-ended quotes; providers indicated comfort with platform-mediated payouts; review usefulness acknowledged. | **Supported.** | A/B escrow copy & refund terms during pilots; aim **conversion rate (CVR) +15%**, **disputes <2%**, **chargebacks <0.5%**. |
| **H9 — Seasonality resilience** | Umrah is year-round; diaspora and ziyarah logistics persist off-peak. | Some pilgrims indicated **post-Hajj** and **off-peak** needs; intensity varies by segment and country. | **Partial.** | Define off-peak segments & content; later track **Trip-Active WAU/MAU ≥ 0.60, Global WAU/MAU (T3M median) ≥ 0.30.** and **≥20%** off-peak bookings. |
| **H10 — Supply-side economics & retention** | Providers value predictable payouts and B2B pricing; retention hinges on earnings. | Providers discussed **payout expectations**, **B2B rates**, and service preferences; churn drivers surfaced qualitatively. | **Partial.** | Set **earnings targets** per SKU/market; later track **churn <15%/qtr**, **NRR >100%**. |
| **H11 — Brand credibility & endorsements** | Imam/scholar endorsements and **license badges** reduce perceived risk and nudge choice. | Interview ranking exercises placed **endorsements/badges** high among trust signals; outreach via mosques worked. | **Supported.** | Secure **≥3** endorsements; later A/B **badge presence** (target **CTR +20%**, **conversion rate +10%**). |
| **H12 — OTA / halal travel adjacency (Phase 2)** | Consolidated booking desire exists; not core to pre-seed. | Interviewees expressed interest in **one-stop** options; also cited existing solutions; focus remained on core SKUs. | **Adjacent—defer.** | After core validation, test **affiliate APIs**; aim **hotel attach ≥2%**, **CPA within OTA norms**. |

### **MVP-testable future hypotheses**

Based on our primary Hypothesis validation, these are the future hypotheses we are planning to validate with our MVP

| Hypothesis | Why do we believe this? | How will we test it? | Current Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FH1: ≥60% of users complete ≥3 meaningful actions in 14 days (Activation). | Interviews show high ritual/logistics pains (e.g., discovery in 28/30); early deploy implied engagement via 68 installs and K=1.28 virality. | Track via TripID analytics in full beta post-funding; benchmark vs. 40% first-session target. | Validated via Interviews (28/30 support); Partially Validated via Deploy (virality signals positive); Needs Beta Testing for metrics. |
| FH2: ≥25% buy ≥1 service; take rate ≥12% (Marketplace). | Transport opacity in 20/30 interviews; WTP mentions (e.g., 1000 Taka) suggest demand. | Marketplace pilot with escrow; measure refunds ≤5% in post-funding beta. | Validated via Interviews (25/30 support); Needs Beta Testing (no transaction data yet). |
| FH3: Users willing to pay $5-10 for premium features (WTP). | Inferred from mentions (e.g., 70-200 Riyal/600-1500 Taka); low explicit but consistent scam avoidance signals. | Mock upsells/surveys in beta; test $5 sub conversion post-funding. | Partially Validated via Interviews (1/30 explicit, but implied in 20/30 pains); Needs Beta Testing for conversion rates. |
| FH4: Offline mode reduces anxiety for rituals (Usability). | Lap counting in 7/30; strong signals for ritual tools (e.g., H6 at 26/30). | Usability tests (E2); ≥95% error-free completion in post-funding pilots. | Validated via Interviews (25/30 support); Partially Validated via Deploy (basic tracker live, user feedback pending); Needs Beta Testing for error rates. |
| FH5: 100% compliance with licensed suppliers (Trust). | Permit constraints in 21/30; agency distrust in 11/30 highlight verification needs. | Supplier audits; complaints <2/100 in beta fulfillment. | Validated via Interviews (23/30 support); Needs Beta Testing (guardrails in thesis, but no live fulfillment yet). |
| FH6: Language/ritual tools preferred over incumbents (Preference). | Language barrier in 19/30; JTBD like phrasebooks show gaps in WhatsApp/YouTube. | A/B test vs. incumbents; measure preference in post-funding usability. | Validated via Interviews (26/30 support); Partially Validated via Deploy (tracker implies preference over manual tools); Needs Beta Testing for direct comparisons. |
| FH7: ≥20% cross-purchase; ≥30% map returns (Retention). | Discovery pains recur (28/30); connectivity in 19/30 drive repeat use. | Analytics on repeat actions during trip in full beta. | Validated via Interviews (21/30 support); Partially Validated via Deploy (virality suggests stickiness); Needs Beta Testing for repeat metrics. |
| FH8: Escrow/fixed fares cut overpayment (Value). | Wheelchair/transport opacity (20/30); WTP for scam avoidance evident. | User reports of hours saved/overpayment avoided (≥70% ≥5 hours) post-funding. | Validated via Interviews (21/30 support); Needs Beta Testing (no value reports yet). |
| FH9: eSIM bundles as failover (Connectivity). | SIM issues in 19/30; pre-trip JTBD indicate utility. | Onboarding tests; adoption rate in beta. | Validated via Interviews (19/30 support); Needs Beta Testing. |
| FH10: B2B agency upsell viable (Monetization). | Referral patterns in interviews (e.g., agency distrust in 11/30); low explicit B2B. | Pilot white-label with agencies; commission uptake post-funding. | Partially Validated via Interviews (11/30 support); Needs Beta Testing for upsell pilots. |

**Our Validation Philosophy**: **Interviews → Deploy → Scale**

We validate demand before building, test hypotheses before committing resources, and scale only when metrics prove unit economics. This disciplined approach maximizes capital efficiency.

## SECTION 6 — Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP)

We serve two primary customers—pilgrims (B2C) and group leaders/agencies (B2B)—and one tertiary B2B customer (local service providers). Below is a crisp, VC-ready snapshot in the requested format, plus why each segment picks us.

---

### ICP #1 — Pilgrim (B2C)

- **Target industry:** Faith travel (Umrah/Hajj)
- **Role/Persona:** First-time or occasional pilgrim; the family’s “tech helper” who plans for others
- **Geography:** Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia + diaspora (GCC/UK/US/CA)
- **Business size (if B2B):** N/A
- **Pain points:**
  - Clarity on exact steps and sequence; trusted rulings (school/fiqh variants); poor on-site connectivity; cognitive overload during peak days; fragmented guidance across YouTube/WhatsApp/books; language/localization gaps
- **Current solutions used:**
  - Human guides/imams; agency briefings; WhatsApp groups; printed handouts/books; YouTube/TikTok; official apps (e.g., Nusuk; local ministry apps)
- **Why they pick us (fit):**
  - Offline-first, step-by-step rituals and a simple dua journal, with **cited, scholar-approved** content that reduces confusion at the moment of need.

---

### ICP #2 — Group Leader / Agency (B2B) — *also uses us as a sales channel*

- **Target industry:** Imam-led cohorts; Umrah/Hajj tour operators; mosque groups
- **Role/Persona:** Imam or group leader; agency owner/operations lead who needs standardized, cited guidance for cohorts and lighter support load
- **Geography:** Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia; export segments in GCC/UK/US/CA
- **Business size (if B2B):**
  - Imam/mosque cohorts: \~30–150 pilgrims per group
  - Mid-size agencies: \~200–3,000 pilgrims per season
- **Pain points:**
  - Inconsistent training quality; repetitive Q&A on WhatsApp; multilingual content gaps; ensuring pilgrims actually follow steps; lack of printable/offline materials; seasonality in demand
- **Current solutions used:**
  - In-person workshops; PDFs/printouts; WhatsApp broadcasts; DIY slide decks; reliance on on-site human guides only
- **Why they pick us (fit):**
  - **Cited, scholar-approved content** they can hand to every pilgrim (less repetitive Q&A).
  - **White-label/cohort tools** to standardize prep across groups.
  - **Sales channel:** we can route pilgrims to their packages and cohorts, supporting **B2B rates** and **2–5% commission norms** (from interviews and our sales-partner experience), creating incremental demand rather than cannibalizing their existing channels.

---

### ICP #3 — Local Service Provider (B2B, tertiary) — *uses us as a sales channel*

- **Target industry:** Transport operators (airport⇄hotel; ziyarah routes), private guides, local ziyarah tour providers
- **Role/Persona:** SME/owner-operator in KSA serving BD/MY/ID pilgrims; wants predictable demand and reputation building
- **Geography:** Primarily KSA (Makkah/Madinah) with BD/MY/ID pilgrim traffic
- **Business size (if B2B):** Micro to SME (single owner-operators up to small fleets)
- **Pain points:**
  - Discovery and trust; inconsistent referrals; opaque pricing; disputes and cancellations; compliance/payments friction
- **Current solutions used:**
  - Word-of-mouth; brokered WhatsApp groups; agency referrals; ad-hoc Facebook pages
- **Why they pick us (fit):**
  - **Targeted sales channel** to reach relevant pilgrims and groups.
  - **Standardized listings & reviews** to build trust and repeat business.
  - **(Later) Payments/escrow and B2B pricing** to smooth cash flow and reduce disputes—activated only after trust KPIs are met.

---

**Positioning note:** We start with **Pilgrim (B2C)** for trust and usage proof, while **Group Leaders/Agencies (B2B)** provide amplification and early revenue optionality (white-label, commission-based referrals). **Local Providers (B2B)** are a tertiary lane we unlock once guidance trust and governance are established.

### Market Scope & Stream Definitions

We segment monetization into four discrete streams, with explicit **no-double-count** rules:

| Stream | Description                                                | Umrah DIY | Umrah Agency | Hajj |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | --------: | -----------: | ---: |
| **S1** | Local services (e.g., rides, tours, eSIMs, equipment hire) |         ✔ |            ✖ |    ✖ |
| **S2** | Agency package referrals                                   |         ✖ |            ✔ |    ✔ |
| **S3** | Hotels & flights booked via an intermediary (OTA-like)     |         ✔ |            ✖ |    ✖ |
| **S4** | Paid application ($10 per unique user)                    |         ✔ |            ✔ |    ✔ |

**Rules:** S1/S3 apply only to **DIY Umrah**; S2 applies only to **agency** cohorts; **Hajj** monetized via **S2+S4** only; **S4** is on **unique users** (Umrah de-duplicated).

**Licensing/Regulatory note:** We do **not** currently hold KSA travel licensure. Any **S3** sales (OTA-like) will commence **only** via licensed partners or post-licensure. **S3 values represent addressable opportunity, not a go-to-market commitment.**

### Section 4 — Key Risks & Mitigations

1. **Regulatory framework (Hajj):** All bookings/visas via authorized platforms (e.g., **Nusuk**).
   *Mitigation:* Operate as referral/education layer aligned with authorized providers.

2. **KSA licensing (OTA operations):** S3 requires a KSA Travel & Tourism Services license or licensed partner.
   *Mitigation:* Secure licensure or partner agreements prior to S3.

3. **Data variability (Umrah origins):** No single centralized source for all origins.
   *Mitigation:* Maintain low/base/high SAM scenarios; cite government/industry sources.

4. **Attach/adoption uncertainty:** OTA attach and paid-app adoption vary by market.
   *Mitigation:* Use conservative bands; tighten with product analytics post-MVP.

*Displayed values may differ by ±$0.01M due to rounding.*

### Minimal Analytics Schema (events)

**Entities:** `user_id`, `trip_id`, `session_id`, `city`, `vendor_id`, `sku_id`, `install_source`.

**Events:**

- Onboarding: `onboard_complete`, `offline_pack_downloaded`
- Rituals: `ritual_start`, `ritual_step_completed`, `ritual_finish`, `ritual_error_undo`
- Maps/POI: `map_opened`, `poi_viewed`, `poi_saved`, `map_returned`
- Marketplace: `service_quote_viewed`, `service_booked`, `service_paid_escrow`, `service_completed`, `dispute_opened`, `refund_processed`
- Routing: `route_request`, `route_blocked`, `route_rerouted_permit_ok`
- Language: `phrase_audio_played`, `translation_used`
- Acquisition: `install_source_attrib` (imam_referral, agency_bundle, fb_group, wa_group, organic)

**Computed metrics:** Activation, purchase rate, fill-rate, confirm-time median (P50) and 90th percentile (P90), on-time %, Weekly to Monthly Active User ratio (WAU/MAU), NPS.

---

### Experiments Plan (first 2–4 weeks)

1. **E1 — Concierge Fill Log**
   n ≥ 50 requests across dayparts and cities; targets: fill ≥80%, P50 confirm ≤30 min, disputes <2%.

2. **E2 — Ritual Usability Lab**
   n = 20 users; targets: error-free ritual completion ≥95%, SUS ≥80; collect CSAT on guidance clarity.

3. **E3 — Channel CAC Micro-Tests**
   Four channels × 100 USD budget each; CPI ≤1.50 USD, signup→activation ≥35%, payback <90 days on service GM.

4. **E4 — Price-Card A/B per SKU**
   Three SKUs with n ≥ 30 per arm; maintain target commission with conversion loss ≤20%.

Optional:
**E5 — Escrow Copy A/B** (conversion rate +15% without disputes rising).

## SECTION 9 — MVP Validation Plan

### Scope & Current Status

We shipped an **offline-first Umrah guidance MVP** (FlutterFlow) with two modules: **Ritual Mode** (step-by-step checklists) and a **Dua Journal**. The released build had **no audio**, **no AI**, **no ziyarah cards**, and **no provider integrations**. Before December, We will add **RAG search (answers with citations)** and **trip-anchored analytics**; We will also formalize an **MoU with Taibah Institute**, who will approve and curate content. We will deploy **whatever is production-ready in the first week of December**.

### Field Signal to Date (Hajj-peak test, June 5–13, 2025; Makkah)

- **Ad spend:** $59.28
- **Paid installs:** 40 (Men 31 @ $1.32 CPI; Women 9 @ $2.01 CPI) → overall CPI ≈ **$1.48**
- **Organic installs during campaign:** 28
- **Total installs during campaign:** 68 → **blended ≈ $0.87/install**
- **Cumulative installs to Aug 11, 2025:** **91** (Paid 40, Organic 51)
- **Implied virality (K):** **0.70** during campaign; **≈1.28** cumulative
- **Geo mix (n=91):** ME/India 55; APAC 20; USA/Canada 14; Europe 1; LatAm/Caribbean 1
- **Play Store:** 12 fully organic, founder-led installs

**Takeaway.** Even without analytics or AI, early adoption showed **healthy blended cost** and **encouraging organic pickup** in a pilgrimage context.

---

### What we Will Ship Before December

- **RAG Guidance (text, with citations).** Answers from vetted Umrah/Hajj sources; visible references; refusal policy for out-of-scope questions; offline fallback to Ritual Mode.
- **Trip-Anchored Analytics.** Minimal, privacy-safe event schema keyed to **TripID**.
- **Lightweight Ziyarah & Local Guidance Cards (content-only).** A small set of cards (no bookings) to measure interest/utility in-destination.
- **Localization & Onboarding.** Bangla + English + Malay / Bahasa (if translator available); time-to-first-checklist-action ≤ 60s.
- **Governance.** MoU with **Taibah Institute**; Taibah decides inclusions and phrasing; We enforce verbatim citations and a transparent change log.

---

### Hypotheses in Scope (readable narrative + metrics)

**H1 — Problem–solution fit (Umrah guidance, in peak conditions).**
In December we will validate whether guidance solves an immediate need **during busy periods**. we will consider this passed if **≥50%** of new signups complete a key action in their first session (start a checklist step or create a dua). Because the window is short, **Trip-Day Coverage** will be reported descriptively; for trips that finish within the window, we are targeting **Trip NPS ≥ 40 (post-beta target)**.

**H1a — Live-during-ritual usage vs pre/post usage.**
We want to know **when** people actually use guidance (e.g., Tawaf). We will classify events into:

- **Live**: a step page is opened ≤2 minutes before the matching **step_completed** event, on the same Trip Day.
- **Pre**: a step page is opened >60 minutes before its completion (study/prep).
- **Post**: a step page is opened after completion (review/debrief).

**Decision signal.** If **Live Usage Ratio** (Live / \[Live+Pre+Post]) is **<10%** and **Pre** dominates, we will prioritize **pre-Umrah training modules** (Duolingo-style micro-lessons) over live guidance UX work. If Live ≥30%, we will equally be investing in both live ritual UX and **pre-Umrah training modules** (Duolingo-style micro-lessons)

**H2 — Ziyarah & Local Guidance card utility (TripAdvisor-like signal).**
We will add **content-only** cards for a small set of sites and local guidance topics. Success looks like **≥50%** of trip-active users open ≥2 cards, with median **time-on-card ≥20s**. If engagement is high, we will expand toward a **TripAdvisor-for-Makkah/Madinah** content layer (still self-guided, no bookings).

**H6 — Guidance accuracy & safety (RAG + citations).**
RAG answers must be precise, safe, and transparent. The bar is **zero harmful outputs**, **≤5%** ambiguous answers resolved within **24 hours**, and **source-view ≥25%** among active users. Sampled sessions should show **CSAT ≥ 4.3/5**.

**H11 — Brand credibility & endorsements (Taibah governance).**
Success is the **MoU signed**, Taibah-approved content live with citations, and visible endorsement/source interactions (tracked via **source_view** and **endorsement_view** rates). **Trip NPS** serves as the downstream trust proxy.

**H4 — Acquisition efficiency & repeatability (trust-first).**
We will benchmark paid acquisition against June’s field test, aiming for **CPI within ±25%** of **$1.48** (i.e., **$1.11–$1.85**). With analytics live, we will report **CAC→Activation by channel** and look for **virality K ≥ 0.70** during the December run.

**H6a — AI vs human-verified usage preference.**
We will measure **RAG query adoption** (share of actives issuing ≥1 query; queries per active; repeat-query rate). If <20% of actives use RAG and **source_view** remains high, We will emphasize **curated, human-verified answers** and treat AI as secondary.

**H9 — Dua module behavior (preset vs custom; post-trip revisits).**
We will observe whether users prefer **preset duas** or adding **their own**; We will also track **post-trip revisits** (any dua view/edit ≥7 days after Trip End). If post-trip revisits are **≥20%** of dua creators, We will invest in light post-trip habit features; otherwise we will keep the Dua module minimal.

---

### Success Criteria & Decision Rules

**Go (scale content; prep monetization tests)** if:
Activation **≥40%**, **Trip NPS ≥40 (post-beta target)**, **source-view ≥25%**, **CPI** in band, **K ≥0.70**, **harmful = 0**, crash-free **≥99%**.
Directional signals: **Live Usage ≥30%** → continue live ritual UX; **Card Engagement high** → expand TripAdvisor-like content; **RAG adoption ≥20%** → continue investing in RAG; **Dua revisits ≥20%** → explore post-trip habit features.

**Iterate (tighten trust/UX)** if a single Key Performance Indicator (KPI) misses by **≤20%** with clear fixes (shorten onboarding to lift Activation; surface citations earlier to lift source-view; refine chunks/reranker to reduce ambiguity; reword card titles to raise card engagement).

**Pivot (content model)** if **harmful outputs persist** or **Trip NPS < 0** despite fixes: move to **curated, scholar-controlled guidance** under Taibah editorial ownership (no RAG answers), keep analytics, and reassess AI later.

**Fallback (business model)** if **self-guided** usage/activation remains weak after a confirmation test: shift focus to **agency-curated flows, package marketplace**, and OTA distribution. Long-term, if obtaining an **Umrah license** is blocked, We will sell via **licensed agency partners**.

---

### Minimal Instrumentation (production)

- **Core:** `trip_start` (TripID, type, est_length, language), `trip_day_heartbeat` (first key action per day, key_action), `checklist_step`, `checklist_complete`
- **Timing tags (for Live vs Pre/Post):** timestamps on `step_open` and `checklist_complete` to compute classification windows (≤2m, >60m, after-complete)
- **Cards:** `card_open` (type=ziyarah/local, site_id/topic, offline y/n), `card_dwell_ms`
- **RAG:** `rag_query`, `rag_answer_shown` (source_ids), `answer_feedback`
- **Dua:** `dua_journal_open`, `dua_created` (preset/custom), `dua_view`, `dua_edit` (with trip/post-trip flag)
- **Trust & Feedback:** `source_view`, `endorsement_view` (if present), `nps_submit`
- **Acquisition:** `install_source`, `campaign_id`
- **Stack:** Firebase (+ BigQuery) or Amplitude; offline queueing; no PII

---

### Reporting Pack After Early-December Deploy

- **Activation**, **CPI**, **CAC→Activation (by channel)**, **Virality K**, **Trip NPS**, **source-view rate**, stability, and **Taibah endorsement status** with sample **cited answers**.
- Feature-direction signals: **Live Usage Ratio**, **Card Engagement**, **RAG adoption vs curated usage**, and **Dua preset/custom split** with post-trip revisit rate.

---

### Out of Scope for This Cycle (Deferred)

We will not test **H3 (WTP/take-rates)**, **H2/H8/H10 (marketplace liquidity, escrow, supply-side economics)**, or **H12 (OTA adjacency)** until content and trust KPIs above are reliably met. Longer-term, We will pursue the **Umrah license**; if licensing remains a blocker, We will distribute through **licensed agency partners**.

---

## SECTION 10 — Pivot Plan

### Scope anchor

We shipped an offline-first **Umrah Ritual Guidance + Dua Journal** MVP. Before early December we will add **search over vetted sources with citations (RAG)** and **trip-anchored analytics**, governed by an **MoU with Taibah Institute** (Taibah approves what goes in; we implement). This plan defines how we will pivot if December signals are weak and the guardrails we are putting in place against company-ending risks.

---

### Backup hypothesis (if the MVP fails)

**Pre-Umrah Trainer.** If live, in-ritual usage is weak in peak conditions, We will shift the product’s core value from “live help during Tawaf” to **pre-trip preparation**: short, structured lessons (Duolingo-style), printable/checklist packs, and curated scholar-approved content under the Taibah MoU. Ritual checklists and the Dua Journal remain; the emphasis moves to “arrive prepared and confident.” Distribution leans on imams, group leaders, and agencies.

### Alternative segment

**Imams and group leaders who run Umrah groups** (Bangladesh/Malaysia/Indonesia + diaspora). They want standardized, cited materials to give pilgrims pre-trip and light, opt-in progress signals during the journey. This segment already spends on training/materials and has clear willingness to adopt tools that reduce confusion.

---

### Pivot triggers (explicit)

- **Pre-Umrah Trainer:** Live Usage Ratio **<10%** (vs Pre/Post) despite UX improvements.
- **Curated Companion (no RAG):** any harmful output, or trust stays low (**NPS < 0**) after fixes.
- **Agency-Led Edition:** activation **<25%** after a confirmation test.
- **Partner-only OTA:** Umrah license remains out of reach; sell via licensed agencies until licensing is viable.

---

### what we will watch for (feature-direction signals)

- **Live vs Pre/Post usage** in Tawaf/Sa’i → direction of investment (live UX vs pre-trip lessons).
- **Ziyarah/Local cards** (content-only) → if ≥50% of active travelers open ≥2 cards with healthy dwell time, expand toward a **TripAdvisor-like** layer.
- **AI (RAG) usage** → if <20% of actives use RAG while **source-views** remain high, prioritize **curated** answers.
- **Dua behavior** → preset vs custom; any **post-trip revisits** may justify light habit features.

    **Guardrail:** scope freeze for the sprint; daily “must-ship” list; recovery buffer post-launch.

---

### High-priority mitigation program (cross-cutting)

1) **Trust & safety first:** Taibah MoU, citations everywhere, refusal-first RAG, 24-hour review, curated kill-switch.
2) **Trip-anchored analytics:** minimal, reliable telemetry to learn from December even at small scale.
3) **Activation discipline:** ≤60-second onboarding, auto-start first action, localization.
4) **Offline reliability:** small packs, staged rollouts, low-end Android testing, crash-free target ≥99%.
5) **Capital efficiency:** concentrate spend on Umrah peaks, lean ops between peaks, B2B pilots to diversify revenue.

---

### Alternate ideas (for future optionality)

1) **Taibah Companion (B2B/B2C):** scholar-curated prep app + printable packs; license to agencies/imams; optional consumer prep module.
2) **Group Leader Console (B2B):** distribute checklists/reminders; view opt-in milestones; reduce on-trip confusion.
3) **Masjid Prep Kits (B2B2C):** turnkey workshop (slides + QR packs) ahead of Umrah peaks to drive organic installs.

---

## SECTION 11 — Final Go/No-Go Decision

### Our call (concise)

**GO - We proceed with confidence based on validated demand and clear execution path.**
Idea Type B — Clear problem + weak/outdated solutions.

---

### Why now (signals so far)

- **Real need + shipped product.** 30+ interviews consistently surfaced clarity/trust gaps; our offline-first MVP (ritual checklists + dua journal) is live.
- **Efficient acquisition under peak stress.** Hajj-peak test (Jun 5–13, 2025): spend **$59.28** → **40** paid installs (**CPI ≈ $1.48**), **28** organic during the same window (total **68**); cumulative to Aug 11: **91** installs; implied virality **K ≈ 1.28**.
- **Risks are governable.** Scholar MoU in motion, citations by default, refusal policy, curated kill-switch; explicit pivot doors if live usage or trust underperform.

---

### What “GO” means for us

We will deploy pre-seed to:

- **Trust & governance:** execute the **Taibah MoU** and ship a cited, scholar-approved Top-100 corpus; refusal-first policy with a curated kill-switch.
- **Measurement:** ship **TripID analytics** (Activation, source-view, K, crash-free) and verify on low-end Android.
- **Distribution:** reconfirm CPI/K with capped micro-bursts while we build imam/agency cohorts and white-label options.

---

### Decision gates (funding milestones we’ll report against)

| Gate             | What must be true              | Evidence / Target                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trust**        | Scholar governance is in force | Taibah MoU executed; Top-100 approved content live with citations; **0** harmful outputs in audit |
| **Activation**   | First-session value is obvious | **≥40%** complete a key action (start a checklist step or create a dua); crash-free **≥99%**      |
| **Distribution** | Paid + organic are repeatable  | CPI **$1.11–$1.85**; virality **K ≥ 0.70** via community channels                               |
| **Direction**    | Live vs Pre/Post is clear      | **Live Usage Ratio ≥30%** → invest in live UX; **<10%** → prioritize **Pre-Umrah Trainer**        |

### Pre-committed pivots

- **Live <10%** → **Pre-Umrah Trainer** (micro-lessons + printables).
- **Any harmful output / NPS < 0** → **Curated Companion** (no RAG answers; fully cited, scholar-controlled content).
- **Activation <25%** after fixes → **Agency-Led Edition** (white-label via imams/agencies).

---

### Investor lens (balanced view)

- **🚩 Red flags to watch:** (1) Scholar MoU execution & review bandwidth; (2) licensing/partner dependencies for OTA/marketplace; (3) episodic usage may cap LTV without B2B/licensing.
- **✅ Excitement factors:** (1) Efficient early acquisition with organic carry at Hajj peak; (2) uncommon trust architecture (citations, refusal policy, curated kill-switch); (3) a telemetry-tied pivot map (Live vs Pre/Post, card dwell, RAG adoption, dua revisits).

---

### Immediate next steps (first tranche)

1. **Seal Taibah MoU** (scope, citation style, correction SLA, logo usage).
2. **Ship minimal analytics** (Activation, source-view, K; crash-free ≥99%); low-end Android QA.
3. **Run a capped micro-burst** to reconfirm CPI band and organic carry with new creatives.
4. **Rehearse safety & comms** (refusal defaults, curated kill-switch drill, takedown SOP).
5. **Stand up partner lanes** (imam/agency cohorts; lightweight white-label pack).

---

**Bottom line:** we proceed with **GO**, release funds against these gates, and treat December as a validation **stage to fine-tune direction**, not as the go/no-go determinant.

### Appendix K — Stickiness & Seasonality Metrics

Metric definitions (precise)

Key event: any of {ritual_start, ritual_step_completed, ritual_finish, map_opened, poi_saved, service_booked, phrase_audio_played}.

MAU(t): unique user_id with ≥1 key event in the trailing 28 days ending day t.

WAU(t): unique user_id with ≥1 key event in the trailing 7 days ending day t.

Trip-active user: a user with a TripID whose date range overlaps the MAU window.

Trip-Active MAU/WAU: MAU/WAU computed only over trip-active users.

Global WAU/MAU (T3M median): take the monthly WAU/MAU ratio for each of the last 3 complete 28-day windows; report the median.

Targets

Trip-Active WAU/MAU ≥ 0.60 (stretch 0.70) — measures in-trip stickiness without penalizing off-season users.

Global WAU/MAU (T3M median) ≥ 0.30 (stretch 0.35) — portfolio-level floor across seasonality.

Supporting seasonality metric (recommended)

Trip-Day Penetration (TDP): median over trips of
active_trip_days ÷ trip_length_days
where active_trip_day = a day in the trip window with ≥1 key event.
Target: ≥ 65% (stretch ≥ 75%).

Measurement notes

Timezone normalize to user’s local or app default; de-dupe by user_id.

Include offline-queued events once synced; exclude deleted/QA accounts.

If a user has no TripID, they’re excluded from Trip-Active metrics but included in Global metrics.

When trips span >28 days, they still count as trip-active if any day overlaps the window.
