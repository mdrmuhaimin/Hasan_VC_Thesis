# HajjGuide: Venture Studio Thesis

## Executive Summary

We are building **HajjGuide**, a venture-studio–backed platform designed to address the **$1.45 billion** religious tourism technology market. Our focus is on the critical *post-booking, in-destination* stage, serving the needs of **16.8 million annual Umrah pilgrims** and **1.6 million Hajj pilgrims**.

**The Opportunity:**  
Today, the in-destination pilgrimage experience is highly fragmented. Pilgrims often lose valuable time and money due to unverified services, unclear guidance, and logistical difficulties.

**Our Solution:**  
HajjGuide offers three integrated services:

- An **offline-first ritual companion** for guidance without relying on internet access.  
- A **licensed service marketplace** connecting pilgrims to trusted providers.  
- A **curated exploration platform** covering the four key pilgrimage cities: Makkah, Madinah, Taif, and Jeddah.  

**Traction:**

- **Customer validation:** 31 structured interviews confirming strong demand.  
- **Product launch:** An MVP with 91 installs (≈45 organic).  
- **Unit economics:** Average cost per install (CPI) of **$0.87** overall, and **$1.48** for paid channels.  
- **Governance:** Memorandum of Understanding in progress with Taibah Institute for scholar-led content verification.  

**The Ask:**  
We are seeking **pre-seed funding** to validate core market hypotheses through controlled pilots and early operations. Our 12-month target is a **$2.32 million serviceable obtainable market**.  

Planned use of funds includes:

- Strengthening content governance and scholarly review,  
- Improving offline reliability for Android devices,  
- Running concierge-style operations to ensure marketplace liquidity,  
- Developing trip-anchored analytics for user behavior insights.  

**Licensing Note:**  
HajjGuide will not sell Hajj packages directly. Package-style bookings will only be conducted through licensed partners or once appropriate licenses are secured.

## Section 1: Strategic Execution Model

We have identified a critical gap in the **$1.45 billion religious tourism market**. 
**Selected Approach:** **Hybrid Model** – **Rocket Internet rigor** on supply onboarding, pricing control, and unit economics, combined with **BCGDV Solve Model** for high-context, regulated in-destination Umrah workflows.

**Our Focus:**  
We address the *post-booking gap* where traditional online travel agencies (OTAs) fall short. HajjGuide delivers three core services:

- An **offline Ritual Mode** for step-by-step guidance without requiring internet access.  
- A **licensed local services marketplace** for trusted bookings in Makkah, Madinah, Taif, and Jeddah.  
- A **curated Ziyarah Explorer** to help pilgrims navigate religious and historical sites.  

This approach combines the efficiency of digital marketplaces with deep sensitivity to compliance, offline usability, and high-context religious guidance.
By focusing on *in-destination service orchestration*, we create an immediate trust moat in a highly regulated, culturally sensitive environment.

### Evaluation Scores

- **Market Timing:** Umrah volumes are accelerating post-pandemic, with Saudi Vision 2030 targeting **30 million annual pilgrims**  ([Vision 2030][1]). At the same time, Saudi authorities are cracking down on unlicensed operators, driving demand toward compliant, verified platforms ([Saudi Press Agency suspension][2]; [Gulf News][3]).  
- **Team Capability:** Founder **Muhammad Raihan Muhaimin** brings dual expertise in pilgrimage operations and AI/ML product development. Backing from a venture studio provides additional resources and early-stage support.  
- **Resource Requirements:** Moderate-to-high investment is needed to secure licenses, build the marketplace, develop the AI-powered offline companion, and produce multi-language verified content.  
- **Competitive Landscape:** No single platform dominates in-destination digital services. Current competitors are either general OTAs or fragmented offline operators. Our license-first marketplace and offline Ritual Mode create strong defensibility.

### Team Commitment

- **Founder:** Muhammad Raihan Muhaimin (full-time) — background in AI/ML and religious tourism.  
- **Venture Studio:** Providing structural support and early funding to transition into accelerator and pre-seed phases.  

### Evidence of Problem-Solving

- Piloted **manually curated Umrah bundles** (flights, visas, hotels) through local agents.  
- Developed and deployed a **dua and ritual guidance app** that successfully assisted pilgrims during Hajj 2024.  

### Strategic Wedge

Our wedge is a bundled solution:  
**DIY Umrah tools + Offline Ritual Mode + Ziyarah Explorer** — designed to work seamlessly without internet access, with flexible options to switch between self-guided journeys and hiring verified guides.  

### Why Now

The market is at a tipping point:

- Pilgrim volumes are growing rapidly.  
- Regulatory enforcement is pushing travelers toward licensed operators.  
- Generic OTAs are not addressing the critical in-destination experience.  

This creates a window of opportunity for a license-first, offline-capable platform to establish leadership.

### 12-Month “Must Be True” Milestones (after public beta)

- **Activation:** At least 60% of travelers complete three or more meaningful actions within 14 days.  
- **Marketplace:** At least 25% of active users purchase one or more local services; platform take rate ≥12%; refunds ≤5%.  
- **Compliance:** 100% of bookings fulfilled by licensed suppliers; fewer than 2 complaints per 100 orders.  
- **Outcome:** At least 70% of users report saving five or more hours or avoiding significant overpayment.  
- **Retention:** At least 20% make multiple purchases during their trip; 30% return to the Ziyarah Map tool while traveling.  

### Guardrails (Day 1)

- Hajj packages will only be offered via authorized providers; direct-to-consumer focus remains on Umrah and in-destination services.  
- All data practices are compliant with Saudi privacy law (PDPL), including user consent logs for location and microphone access.  
- License-first marketplace with transparent display of provider license IDs and expiry dates.

## Section 2: Problem Statement

### Industry

Our focus lies at the intersection of **Religious Tourism (Hajj/Umrah)** and **In-Destination Travel Technology**.

### Opportunity Description

The global Muslim travel market is projected to exceed **$225 billion by 2028** ([CrescentRating][17]). Within this, Hajj and Umrah represent the most logistically complex and spiritually significant segments. While booking flights and packages has become largely digital, the *in-destination experience* is still fragmented, offline, and heavily dependent on unverified, often overpriced local operators.

### Core Problem

Once in Saudi Arabia, first-time and DIY Umrah travelers face:

- **Ritual anxiety** from fear of making religious mistakes.  
- **Opaque, overpriced services** without license verification.  
- **Language barriers** and cultural friction.  
- **Crowd and closure uncertainty** at key sites.  
- **Weak discovery** of authentic ziyarah (sacred site) locations.  
- **Separation risks** in dense crowds.  

Instead of focusing on worship, many travelers are forced into constant logistical problem-solving and juggling multiple apps.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Our primary audience is **DIY and semi-DIY Umrah travelers aged 25–45** from Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and global diaspora markets.  

Key characteristics:

- App-native, comfortable with digital tools.  
- Book flights and hotels through mainstream online travel agencies (OTAs).  
- Coordinate trips through WhatsApp and social groups.  
- Actively seek offline ritual guidance, licensed service providers, and trustworthy exploration resources.  

### Why Incumbents Don’t Win

- OTAs optimize for **pre-trip sales conversion**, not for in-trip decision-making.  
- Pilgrimage requires **real-time, context-specific, and faith-sensitive guidance**.  
- Official channels are critical for permits and inventory, but are **not built for concierge-level personalization** or hybrid “self-service + hire support” models.  

### "Hair-on-Fire" Evidence

| Evidence                                                                                                 | Impact on Pilgrims                                        | Source                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Seven Umrah companies suspended (Jun 17, 2024)** for failing transport commitments                      | Travelers stranded; ministry arranged emergency alternatives | ([Saudi Press Agency][2]) |
| **Ten travel offices shut (Jul 13, 2024)** for running unlicensed Umrah services                          | Bookings voided; deposits lost or at risk                  | ([Gulf News][3])          |
| **Real-world delay:** Malaysian pilgrim waited **2 days under airport canopies** then bought new tickets | Lost 48 hours and paid additional airfare                  | ([RSIS International][4]) |

### Quantified Pain

- **Time Loss:** Hours wasted per trip resolving logistics and finding trusted services.  
- **Financial Loss:** Significant overpayment for transport, tours, and mobility aids.  
- **Frequency:** Pain recurs every trip, with particularly high stakes for first-time pilgrims.  

### One-Sentence Pitch (YC Format)

Independent Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia struggle with ritual anxiety, overpriced unverified services, and poor discovery because in-destination support is fragmented and not faith-aware.

### Pillar Gap: Differentiation Index (from attached analysis)

**Method.** For each competitor in BD/MY/ID and adjacent GCC players, we scored the three pillars on a 1–5 scale: **Ritual Mode**, **Ziyarah Explorer**, **License-First**. The **Differentiation Index** is the average of those three.

- Market baseline (mean / median): **2.26 / 2.33** out of 5.
- No incumbent exceeds **3.67/5** on our pillars (i.e., no one is “excellent” across all three).

#### Top 8 (closest to our pillars, ↑ = higher resemblance)

| Rank | Company                        | Differentiation Index |
| ---: | ------------------------------ | :-------------------: |
|    1 | Nusuk (Hajj & Umrah)           |        **4.3**       |
|    2 | Umrahme (Traveazy Group)       |        **3.67**       |
|    3 | IKHLAS by Capital A (AirAsia)  |        **3.00**       |
|    3 | Umroh.com (Indonesia)          |        **3.00**       |
|    3 | Muslim Pro                     |        **3.00**       |
|    6 | Zamzam.com (JV with TBO)       |        **2.67**       |
|    6 | TBO Umrah (TBO Tek Ltd)        |        **2.67**       |
|    8 | Maqam GDS (Official Umrah GDS) |        **2.33**       |
|    8 | tiket.com (with Umroh.com)     |        **2.33**       |
|    8 | Funadiq                        |        **2.33**       |
|    8 | Almosafer (Seera Group)        |        **2.33**       |

**Takeaway.** Other than Nusuk any front-runners are **not** integrating: (1) offline, fiqh-approved **Ritual Mode** + (2) a true **Ziyarah Explorer** + (3) a **license-transparent marketplace** into one in-destination product. On the other hand Nusuk relies on online conncetivity and heavily focused arabic speaker looking for VIP trip. That’s our wedge.

> Derived from: Competitor Rubic from [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rgbg8PFvxG_L-yodOR_RfjXNCsfgLvZ8ZjEdNqVgNlg/edit?gid=1266947592#gid=1266947592).

### Regional Battlefield (Bangladesh • Malaysia • Indonesia)

- **ShareTrip / GoZayaan (Bangladesh OTAs)**: Strong pre-trip funnels; lack offline ritual flows and license-first in-trip orchestration.
- **AmarSafar (Bangladesh B2B2C)**: Agency rails; lacks fiqh-aware in-trip UX and Ziyarah Explorer.
- **Umrahme / Zamzam / TBO**: Deep supply and accreditation; generic in-trip UX; no integrated offline ritual.
- **Muslim Pro**: Massive distribution and hooks; not an in-trip, license-badged marketplace; no offline ritual flow.

### What this means for GTM (crisply)

- **Message:** “Only app with scholar-approved **offline Ritual Mode**, a curated **Ziyarah Explorer**, and a **license-first** local services marketplace.”
- **Proof:** Screens showing offline steps; license badges (provider IDs and issuing authority) in every listing; mention Shariah governance.
- **Channel:** Imam/mosque cohorts and agency bundles to neutralize OTA scale; layered with paid performance in key corridors.
- **Focus SKUs:** Fixed-fare transport and guide listings with escrow (funds held until service completion); tours later.
- **Copy tests:** Feature the three-pillar badges on install/landing; measure CTR (Click-Through Rate) and CVR (Conversion Rate) uplift versus generic OTA copy.

### Risks to monitor (competitive moves)

- **Umrahme/Zamzam** add a lightweight “ritual checklist” and call it done → We maintain advantage on **offline operation, fiqh citation, and license transparency.**
- **Nusuk** expands consumer-facing guidance → We remain “rail-compatible,” partnering where possible while owning the concierge/marketplace layer.
- **BD/MY OTAs** bolt on white-label guides via WhatsApp →  Differentiate on **governance, offline UX, and license‑badged marketplace** with escrow and standardized pricing.

### Defensible Edge & Go-to-Market

#### Our Unique Insight

The critical in-destination gap for Umrah pilgrims is not booking transport or hotels — it’s **ritual confidence, trusted licensed services, and contextual exploration** during the trip. No incumbent integrates offline usability, fiqh-verified guidance, and licensed local providers into a single, seamless experience.

#### Competitive Differentiation

- **Offline Ritual Mode** — step-by-step, fiqh-approved guidance without internet dependency.
- **Ziyarah Explorer** — curated 4-city pilgrimage maps (Makkah, Madinah, Taif, Jeddah) with Solo/Hire toggle at every point of interest.
- **License-First Marketplace** — transparent provider credentials, verified compliance, pre-quoted pricing, and integrated reviews.

**Go-to-Market Strategy**
Partner with **licensed local travel agencies** in key origin markets to:

## Section 4 — Discovery Interviews

### Overview

We conducted 31 structured interviews across users (pilgrims), economic buyers (agency owners/operators), industry experts, and adjacent providers to validate problem salience, Willingness to Pay (WTP), and distribution paths. This section summarizes the sample, method, validation scores, monetization signals, planned experiments, and operating assumptions. Key terms and acronyms are defined at the end.

### Interview Mix & Method

- Total interviews: 31
- Primary categories (1 per interviewee for quota discipline):
  - Users (pilgrims): 20
  - Economic Buyers (agencies/operators): 8
  - Industry Experts: 1
  - Adjacent (local providers/entrepreneurs): 2
- Dual-role note: Many “Buyer” interviewees also provided secondary “Expert” input for evidence; each interviewee retains a single primary category for counts.
- Recruitment channels: known community members, diaspora Facebook/WhatsApp groups, and agency work networks; group leaders acted as affiliate referrers.
- Sampling considerations: over-indexed to Bangladesh (BD) with coverage of KSA-based providers and some diaspora (e.g., Canada). Findings are directionally strong; we will broaden geography in subsequent waves.

### Problem Validation Scorecard

The interviews were scored against five core criteria to assess the viability of the opportunity. The results strongly validate our thesis.

| Criteria                   | Score | Evidence Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Problem Urgency**        | **5/5** | Over 90% of pilgrims independently cited high-stakes friction related to worship logistics, including permit/route constraints, difficulty finding trusted transport and guides, and lack of price transparency.                                                                         |
| **Problem Frequency**      | **5/5** | These issues recur at multiple stages of the journey (e.g., airport arrival, inter-city travel, local visits), with most users reporting several frustrating touchpoints per day.                                                                                                        |
| **Willingness to Pay (WTP)** | **4/5** | WTP is well-established, as pilgrims already pay significant fees for packages, tours, and transport. Interviews confirmed an appetite for our specific solutions, validating key revenue streams (see Monetization Signals below).                                                      |
| **Market Size Validation** | **4/5** | Initial target geographies (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia) represent some of the largest Umrah source markets globally, confirming a substantial Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) accessible via our agency-led distribution model.                                             |
| **Execution Feasibility**  | **4/5** | Our model avoids direct operational complexity by acting as a marketplace for existing licensed providers. Key risks (e.g., payments, data quality) are mitigated through clear operational policies and partnerships.                                                                     |

Total Validation Score: **22/25***

### WTP Priorities (High → Low)

1) Agency-based end-to-end guided tour (agency-bundled upsell with escrow)
2) Transport (airport↔hotel + Ziyarah fixed-fare)
3) Private guide (substitutable for many by in-app guidance)
Removed from near-term scope: wheelchair; eSIM deprioritized unless agency-driven.

### Monetization Signals (interviews + founder inputs)

- **Agency bundles**: typical commission 2–5%; many agencies offer B2B rates for platform distribution. The founder currently monetizes as a Sales Partner.
- **Transport**: referral fee norms around 20%; B2B rates available per supplier interviews.
- **Guidance**: in-app module at $5–$10 one-time (some up to $20); private guide fees usually bundled with Ziyarah or full packages.

### Validation Preview (for Section 7)

- **Agency-guided tour (bundled tiers):** Present Lite/Standard/Premium anchored to B2B rates and 2–5% commission norms. 
  - **Target:** ≥40% choose any paid tier in interview simulations (or meet channel-benchmark attach if baseline is lower).
- **Transport (fixed-fare bands):** Offer 3 fare bands on common routes + escrow option. 
  - **Target:** ≥60% choose a band and accept in-app booking; 
  - **Supply-side:** ≥70% of providers consent to the target take-rate (benchmarked to \~20%).
- **Private guide vs in-app:** Side-by-side daily guide fee vs app module at **$5–$10**. 
  - **Target:** ≥50% select app-only at these price points.

### Operating Assumptions (to sustain Solution Difficulty = 4/5)

1. **No direct fulfillment** (we list/route; we do not operate transport/tours).
2. **Payments** collected by the agency or via a compliant PSP (Payment Service Provider) with escrow/settlement; KYC (Know Your Customer)/AML (Anti-Money Laundering) handled.  
3. **License-first supplier policy** with visible badges and periodic checks.
4. **Disputes & refunds** documented SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) with response SLAs (Service-Level Agreements).
5. **Data QA** pipeline for itinerary/hotel/guidance content with offline fallback.

## Section 5 — Hypothesis Mapping

### Scope and Maturity

At the pre-seed stage, our hypotheses are grounded in 31 structured discovery interviews and limited pre-build experiments (e.g., a peak-season Hajj test with a basic ritual tracker yielding 68 installs). Full quantitative validation will follow once analytics and broader product testing are funded. Each hypothesis includes the belief, rationale, evidence to date, status, and the next test with target metrics.

### Hypothesis Taxonomy and Mapping

Core H‑series hypotheses (interview‑validated) inform two downstream layers: (1) near‑term trust/usability/compliance tests (FH) and (2) later‑phase monetization/durability KPIs.

| Core Hypothesis | What it asserts                                   | Linked Future Hypotheses (near‑term and later‑phase)                |

| H3              | WTP and take‑rate are viable                       | FH8 (Purchase conversion), FH9 (Premium pricing)                    |
| H5              | Compliance reduces risk                            | FH3 (Pre‑listing verification; complaints measured later)           |
| H6              | Scholar‑endorsed, offline guidance preferred       | FH2 (Usability), FH4 (Preference vs incumbents)                     |
| H7              | Group‑aware routing adds value                     | FH5 (Map returns/repeat usage proxy)                                |
| H8              | Escrow + fixed fares increase trust and CVR        | FH6 (Perceived certainty/value; survey‑only in v1)                  |
| H9              | Seasonality resilience matters                     | Tracked later (off‑peak WAU/MAU, booking share)                     |
| H10             | Supply economics underpin provider retention       | Tracked later (provider churn, NRR)                                 |

| ID  | Hypothesis (metric target)                                                        | Rationale                                                                                                  | Test plan                                                                                   | Current status                                                                                  |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### D. Validation Philosophy

Interviews → Build → Instrumented product tests (trust and usability) → Monetization pilots → Durability (seasonality and supply). Revenue and channel tests run only after trust and reliability metrics clear targets. We validate demand before building, confirm trust and reliability before monetization, and scale only after unit economics and durability are proven.

### E. Acronyms and Metrics (for accessibility)

- Activation: share of users completing a defined set of actions (here, ≥3 meaningful actions in 14 days; e.g., ritual_start, ritual_finish, map_opened, poi_saved, phrase_audio_played).
- WTP (Willingness to Pay): what a customer is prepared to pay for a product or feature.
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): total cost to acquire a customer; CPI (Cost Per Install): cost to acquire an app install.
- NPS (Net Promoter Score): −100 to +100 measure of advocacy; 40+ is strong for consumer apps (30 used as an early gate).
- CSAT (Customer Satisfaction): post‑interaction satisfaction rating, typically 1–5.
- CVR/CTR (Conversion Rate/Click‑Through Rate): engagement and purchase funnel metrics.
- WAU/MAU (Weekly/Monthly Active Users): engagement ratio indicating habit; Trip‑Active WAU/MAU focuses on users currently on trip; T3M: trailing three‑month period.
- PSP (Payment Service Provider): third party that processes payments; escrow holds funds until service completion.
- KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti‑Money Laundering): identity and compliance checks.
- NRR (Net Revenue Retention): cohort revenue including expansion/churn; >100% implies net expansion.
- SKU: service type or offer (e.g., transport, guide).
- BDT: Bangladeshi Taka (currency).
- Ziyarah: religious visits to historically or spiritually significant sites.
- p90: the 90th percentile (e.g., 90% of confirmations occur within this time).
- n: sample size used for a given measurement.

## Section 6 — Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP)

We serve two primary customers—pilgrims (B2C) and group leaders/agencies (B2B)—and one tertiary B2B customer (local service providers). This section outlines who they are, their pain points, current alternatives, why we fit, and how we reach them.

### ICP #1 — Pilgrim (B2C)

- Target category: Faith travel (Umrah/Hajj)
- Role/Persona: First-time or occasional pilgrim; often the family’s “tech helper”
- Geography: Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia + diaspora (GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council)/UK/US/Canada)
- Pain points:
  - Need clarity on exact steps and sequence; trusted rulings across schools/fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence)
  - Poor on-site connectivity; cognitive overload during peak days
  - Fragmented guidance across YouTube/WhatsApp/books; language/localization gaps
- Current alternatives:
  - Human guides/imams; agency briefings; WhatsApp groups; printed handouts/books; YouTube/TikTok; official apps (e.g., Nusuk; local ministry apps)
- Why they pick us:
  - Offline-first Ritual Mode and a simple dua journal with cited, scholar-approved content—reducing confusion at the moment of need
- Primary acquisition channels (aligned with H4):
  - Imam/mosque referrals, agency cohorts, diaspora Facebook/WhatsApp groups, and organic search/store

### ICP #2 — Group Leader / Agency (B2B)

- Target category: Imam-led cohorts; Umrah/Hajj tour operators; mosque groups
- Role/Persona: Imam or group leader; agency owner/ops lead seeking standardized, cited guidance and lower support load
- Geography: Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia; export segments in GCC/UK/US/Canada
- Business size:
  - Imam/mosque cohorts: ~30–150 pilgrims per group
  - Mid-size agencies: ~200–3,000 pilgrims per season
- Pain points:
  - Inconsistent training quality; repetitive Q&A on WhatsApp; multilingual content gaps
  - Ensuring pilgrims actually follow steps; lack of printable/offline materials; seasonality in demand
- Current alternatives:
  - In-person workshops; PDFs/printouts; WhatsApp broadcasts; DIY slide decks; reliance on on-site human guides only
- Why they pick us:
  - Cited, scholar-approved content they can hand to every pilgrim (less repetitive Q&A)
  - Cohort tools to standardize preparation across groups (white-label optionality)
  - Post-trust (later phase): ability to list cohorts/packages with B2B rates and 2–5% commission norms as an additional distribution lane
- Primary acquisition/partnership channels:
  - Imam networks, mosque boards, regional agency associations, and diaspora community leaders

### ICP #3 — Local Service Provider (B2B, tertiary; later phase)

- Target category: Transport operators (airport↔hotel; ziyarah routes), private guides, local ziyarah tour providers
- Role/Persona: SME/owner-operator in KSA serving BD/MY/ID pilgrims; wants predictable demand and reputation building
- Geography: KSA (Makkah/Madinah) targeting BD/MY/ID pilgrim traffic
- Business size: Micro to SME (single owner-operators up to small fleets)
- Pain points:
  - Discovery and trust; inconsistent referrals; opaque pricing; disputes/cancellations; compliance/payments friction
- Current alternatives:
  - Word-of-mouth; brokered WhatsApp groups; agency referrals; ad-hoc Facebook pages
- Why they pick us (later phase, post-trust):
  - Targeted access to relevant pilgrims and groups; standardized listings and reviews to build trust and repeat business
  - (Later) payment/escrow options and B2B pricing to smooth cash flow and reduce disputes
- Partnership channels:
  - Licensed provider directories, agency partners, and local associations

Positioning

- We start with Pilgrim (B2C) to establish trust and usage proof.
- Group Leaders/Agencies (B2B) amplify distribution and provide future revenue optionality (commission/white-label) once trust KPIs are met.
- Local Providers (B2B) are a tertiary lane activated after governance and content trust are established, consistent with our non-transactional v1 scope.

## Section 7 — Market Sizing (TAM • SAM • SOM)

### Summary

2024 headline (Base):

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM, Base)**: **$1.45B**
  – Umrah: **$1,095.83M**
  – Hajj: **$354.49M**

- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: **$151.49M**
  – Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Malaysia
  - Streams included: S2 (agency referrals) and S4 (paid app)
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM, 12‑month target): $2.32M

Primary reference points:

- Foreign Umrah performers (2024): 16.80M (GASTAT, summarized by [Argaam](https://www.argaam.com/en/article/articledetail/id/1799151))
- Foreign Hajj pilgrims (2024): 1,611,310 ([GASTAT — Hajj Statistics Publication 2024](https://www.stats.gov.sa/documents/20117/2435281/Hajj%2BStatistics%2BPublication%2B2024EN.pdf))

Full derivation: see [Detailed TAM Calculation (2024)](tam_calculation.md); supporting assumptions, sources, S4 adoption bases, and SAM/SOM details are in Appendices A–E.

Notes:

- OTA (Online Travel Agency) activity (S3) is addressable, not a v1 commitment; any S3 execution will be via licensed partners or post‑licensure in KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia).
- All streams follow explicit no‑double‑count rules (see below).

### Monetization Streams (scope and rules)

| Stream | Description                                                | Umrah DIY | Umrah Agency | Hajj |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | --------: | -----------: | ---: |
| S1     | Local services (rides, tours, eSIMs, equipment hire)       |        ✔  |           ✖  |  ✖   |
| S2     | Agency package referrals (commission on booked packages)   |        ✖  |           ✔  |  ✔   |
| S3     | Hotels & flights via intermediary (OTA‑like take‑rates)    |        ✔  |           ✖  |  ✖   |
| S4     | Paid app ($10 per unique user)                             |        ✔  |           ✔  |  ✔   |

Rules:

- S1 and S3 apply only to DIY Umrah cohorts (self‑organized, non‑agency).
- S2 applies to agency cohorts (Umrah and Hajj).
- Hajj monetization is S2 + S4 only.
- S4 is modeled on unique users (de‑duplicated across Umrah).

Licensing/regulatory note:

- We do not currently hold KSA travel licensure. S3 is an addressable opportunity only; execution will be via licensed partners or post‑licensure. This aligns with our trust‑first, non‑transactional v1 scope.

### Section 1 — Total Addressable Market (Global, 2024)

Scenario summary (2024):

| Scenario                                              |      Umrah | Hajj (S2+S4) |     Total |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | ---------: | -----------: | --------: |
| Defensive                                             |   $778.51M |     $339.99M | $1,118.50M |
| Conservative Base |   $919.33M |     $343.21M | $1,262.54M |
| Base               | $1,095.83M | $354.49M | $1,450.32M |
| Aspirational                                          | $1,039.38M |     $354.49M | $1,393.87M |

Base stream breakdown (2024):

| Scenario | Umrah S1 | Umrah S3 | Umrah S2 | Umrah S4 |    UMRAH | Hajj S2 | Hajj S4 |    HAJJ |   TOTAL |
| :------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| Base     | $141.52M | $408.31M | $403.20M | $142.80M | $1,095.83M | $338.38M | $16.11M | $354.49M | $1,450.32M |

S3 per‑DIY calculation (Base):

- (ADR (Average Daily Rate) $80 × LOS (Length of Stay) 6 × hotel take‑rate 14.0% × hotel attach 80%) + (Return fare $700 × air take‑rate 2% × flight attach 50%) = $60.76 per DIY traveler; 6.72M DIY travelers × $60.76 = $408.31M.

Key Base inputs (explicit):

| DIY share | ADR | LOS | Hotel attach | Hotel take‑rate | Return fare | Flight attach | Air take‑rate | S1 per‑DIY | S2 (Umrah) | S4 (Umrah) |
| --------: | --: | --: | -----------: | --------------: | ----------: | ------------: | ------------: | ---------: | ---------: | ---------: |
| 40%       | $80 | 6   | 80%          | 14.0%           | $700        | 50%           | 2% (1–3% sens.) | $21.06     | $2,000 × 2% | 0.85 × $10 |

References:

- Hotel OTA take‑rate: 14.0% (Booking Holdings FY2024 10‑K)
- Air OTA take‑rate: 2% (assumption; low single‑digit based on Expedia mix; show 1–3% sensitivity)

Formulas:

- S3 (DIY): (ADR × LOS × hotel take‑rate × hotel attach %) + (Return fare × air take‑rate × flight attach %)
- S1 (DIY): Σ(attach × price × commission) per local service
- S2 (Agency/Hajj): pilgrims × package price × referral %
- S4 (Umrah/Hajj): unique users × $10 × adoption rate

### Section 2 — Serviceable Addressable Market (Current scope)

Geography: Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia  
Streams included: S2 (agency referrals) and S4 (paid app) only

Hajj quotas (2024):

- Indonesia: 241,000 (Antara)
- Malaysia: 31,600 (The Malaysian Reserve)
- Bangladesh: 127,198 (The Financial Express)

SAM — 2024 Base ($M, rounded to $0.01M):

| Country    | Umrah S2 | Umrah S4 | Hajj S2 | Hajj S4 |   Total |
| :--------- | -------: | -------: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| Indonesia  |   43.20  |   6.88   |  50.61  |  0.72   | 101.42  |
| Malaysia   |    8.00  |   1.70   |   6.64  |  0.11   |  16.45  |
| Bangladesh |    6.00  |   0.59   |  26.71  |  0.32   |  33.62  |
| Total      |  57.20   |   9.17   |  83.96  |  1.15   | 151.49  |

Sensitivity (Umrah origin counts): Low $136.29M • Base $151.49M • High $161.13M  
Note: Hajj components are quota‑anchored; Umrah origin counts draw from multiple official/industry sources.

### Section 3 — Serviceable Obtainable Market (12‑month horizon)

Target capture rates:

- Umrah S2: ID 0.6%, MY 1.0%, BD 0.3% (of agency cohorts)
- Hajj S2: 0.8% of each country’s pilgrims
- S4: 12.5% of each country’s adoption ceiling in year one

Capacity constraints:

- Hajj referrals capped at 5,000 seats/year (targets do not exceed the cap)

SOM — 12‑month target ($M; users rounded to nearest 100):

| Country    | Umrah S2 ($M) | Referrals | Umrah S4 ($M) |   Payers | Hajj S2 ($M) |  Seats | Hajj S4 ($M) |  Payers | Total ($M) |
| :--------- | -------------: | --------: | -------------: | -------: | ------------: | -----: | ------------: | ------: | ---------: |
| Indonesia  |           0.26 |     6,500 |           0.86 |   86,100 |          0.40 |  1,900 |          0.09 |   9,000 |      1.62  |
| Malaysia   |           0.08 |     2,000 |           0.21 |   21,200 |          0.05 |    300 |          0.01 |   1,400 |      0.36  |
| Bangladesh |           0.02 |       400 |           0.07 |    7,400 |          0.21 |  1,000 |          0.04 |   4,000 |      0.35  |
| Total      |           0.36 |     8,900 |           1.15 |  114,700 |          0.67 |  3,200 |          0.14 |  14,400 |      2.32  |

S4 adoption ceiling:

- See per‑country unique user bases and sources in the Appendix or the linked TAM document; S4 modeled at $10.

### Section 4 — Key Risks & Mitigations

1) Regulatory framework (Hajj)  
Risk: All bookings/visas via authorized platforms (e.g., Nusuk).  
Mitigation: Operate as a referral/education layer aligned with authorized providers.

2) KSA licensing (OTA operations)  
Risk: S3 requires a KSA Travel & Tourism Services license or licensed partner.  
Mitigation: Secure licensure or partner agreements prior to S3 execution.

3) Data variability (Umrah origins)  
Risk: No single centralized source for all origin counts.  
Mitigation: Maintain low/base/high SAM scenarios; cite government/industry sources.

4) Attach/adoption uncertainty  
Risk: OTA attach and paid‑app adoption vary by market.  
Mitigation: Use conservative input bands; tighten with product analytics post‑v1.

Assumptions and rounding:

- Some values may differ by ±$0.01M due to rounding.

## Section 8 — MVP Canvas Plan — HajjGuide (Pre-Seed)

### TL;DR

- **Goal**: Validate trust-first problem–solution fit for DIY Umrah guidance and in-destination utility (no transactions in this phase).
- **Scope (v1)**: Offline-first Ritual Mode, compliant routing hints, Ziyarah Explorer (offline POIs), phrasebook/translation, scholar-governed content with visible citations, and optional light eSIM attach.
- **Primary success gates** (v1 controlled release):
  - Activation ≥40% (n ≥ 50),
  - Trust NPS (Net Promoter Score) ≥30 (n ≥ 30),
  - Ritual task success ≥95% (moderated; n ≥ 20),
  - Source_view rate ≥25%, crash-free ≥99%.

### Objective, Scope, and Target Segments

- Objective: **Validate**
  - H1 (problem–solution fit),
  - H4 (acquisition paths),
  - H5 (compliance signaling),
  - H6 (guidance preference and accuracy),
  - H7 (coordination proxies), and
  - H11 (endorsements/credibility)
  - As well as near-term FH1–FH7 using an offline-first app with instrumented analytics.
- Scope (v1): Trust-first guidance and in-destination utility; Offline Ritual Mode, compliant routing hints, Ziyarah Explorer (offline POIs), and language tools (phrasebook/translation). No transactional integrations in v1.
- Deferred (out of scope for v1): H2/H8/H10 (marketplace liquidity, escrow, supply-side economics), H3 (WTP (Willingness to Pay)/take-rate), H9 (seasonality resilience). These will be tested after trust and content KPIs are met (see Section 9).
- Primary ICP (Ideal Customer Profile): DIY or semi-DIY Umrah pilgrims aged 25–45, digital-native, from Bangladesh/Indonesia/Malaysia and the English-speaking diaspora.
- Amplifiers: Group leaders and local agencies as distribution partners and credibility anchors (non-transactional partnerships in v1).

### Sketch / MVP Description (no code)

A lightweight, offline-first Umrah companion app focused on trust and guidance:

- Users download an offline pack (ritual steps, city POIs, citations).
- Ritual Mode provides step cards and a lap counter for Tawaf/Sa’i; all content is scholar-approved with visible sources. 
- Ziyarah Explorer offers offline points of interest across Makkah, Madinah, Taif, and Jeddah; a Solo/Hire toggle is presented as information only (no in‑app bookings; any external contact is user‑initiated and outside the app).
- Compliant routing hints surface permit-aware reminders and soft re-route guidance.
- Optional language tools (phrasebook + offline audio) lower friction in destination.
- Analytics measure Activation, trust signals (source_view), stability, and engagement (Map Return Rate).
- If time permits enhance ritual mode and ziyarah explorer further using AI. ( Q&A citation using RAG )

Flow sketch (text)

  ├─ Ritual Mode → Step cards → Lap counter → Finish → Feedback  
  ├─ Ziyarah Explorer → POI → Save → Map return (same-session)  
  └─ Routing Help → Permit hint → Soft re-route guidance  
Feedback → Optional language pack

Validation linkage: Hypothesis mapping and experiment design live in Section 9 (MVP Validation Plan). Section 8 intentionally avoids duplicating those details.

### Core Features (ranked by value)

1) Offline Ritual Mode (step cards, lap counter, scholar-approved content with citations)  
2) Ziyarah Explorer (offline POIs; Solo/Hire toggle presented as content-only)  
3) Compliant Routing Hints (permit-aware reminders; soft-fail to content when uncertain)  
4) Trust & Governance UI (source citations, endorsement badges)  
5) Phrasebook + Translation (offline audio for key phrases)  
6) Light eSIM attach (links only; measured as an observed, non-gating metric)

### What We Will Exclude from v1

- Transactions and marketplace flows (no bookings, no escrow, no price cards)
- Supply onboarding/operations and any manual/concierge activity
- Advanced AI concierge or voice; community feeds/journaling
- Full B2B (Business-to-Business) console; hotel OTA (Online Travel Agency) layer
- Group location sharing; anything requiring background location

### MVP Success Criteria (measurable)

- **Activation**: ≥40% of users complete ≥3 core actions in 14 days (n ≥ 50). Core actions: {ritual_start, ritual_finish, map_opened, poi_saved, phrase_audio_played}.
- **Ritual task success**: ≥95% error-free completion in moderated usability sessions (n ≥ 20).
- **Trust NPS**: ≥30 among active users (n ≥ 30).
- **Source_view rate**: ≥25% of guidance sessions open at least one citation/source.
- **Map Return Rate**: ≥30% of sessions return to the map after first open (same-session).
- **Stability**: Crash-free sessions ≥99% (with emphasis on low-end Android).

### Observed, non-gating (reported only)

- CPI (Cost Per Install) and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) by channel; CPI target band around prior field signal (±25%).
- WAU/MAU (Weekly/Monthly Active Users) and language-tool CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) ≥4.3/5.
- eSIM attach opt-ins as a directional signal.

### Minimal Analytics Schema (events)

Entities: user_id, trip_id, session_id, city, install_source, language.

Events

- Onboarding: onboard_complete, offline_pack_downloaded
- Rituals: ritual_start, ritual_step_completed, ritual_finish, ritual_error_undo
- Maps/POI: map_opened, poi_viewed, poi_saved, map_returned
- Routing: route_request, route_blocked, route_hint_viewed
- Guidance trust: source_view, endorsement_view
- Language: phrase_audio_played, translation_used
- Acquisition: install_source_attrib (imam_referral, agency_bundle, fb_group, wa_group, organic)

Computed: Activation, Map Return Rate, WAU/MAU, Trust NPS, Crash-free %, source_view rate.

### Operational and Compliance Guardrails

- Content governance: scholar double-review; versioned content packs with rollback path.
- Safety and privacy: opt-in location sharing if added later; minimal data collection; offline-first by default.
- Payments and disputes: not active in v1; specifications drafted for later transactional phases.

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Permit rule changes | Routing value and trust | Maintain ruleset content; soft-fail to guidance; frequent policy checks |
| Content errors | Trust loss | Scholar double-review; visible citations; versioned updates with QA |
| Low engagement | Weak signal on fit | Shorten onboarding; improve copy; expand POIs; add language audio quickly |

### Resourcing (lean)

- Product/PM: 0.5 FTE
- Mobile (Flutter): 1.0 FTE
- Backend: 0.5 FTE
- Design/Content (ritual content, POIs): 0.5 FTE
- Scholars: reviewer pool, part-time

### User Flow (concise)

Onboard → Download Offline Pack  
Home  
  ├─ Ritual Mode → Lap Counter → Finish → Feedback  
  ├─ Ziyarah Explorer → POI → Save → Map return  
  └─ Routing Help → Permit hint → Reroute guidance  
Feedback → Light upsell (language pack)

### Reporting Cadence

- Daily: Crash-free, key incidents, time-to-first-action.
- Weekly: Activation cohort, Map Return Rate, Trust NPS, source_view, funnel by channel.
- Gate Review: Decision memo with charts and recommended next actions.

## Section 9 — MVP Validation Plan

### Scope & Current Status

We shipped an **offline-first Umrah guidance MVP** (FlutterFlow) with two modules:

- **Ritual Mode** (step-by-step checklists) and a 
- **Dua Journal**.

The released build had **no audio**, **no AI**, **no ziyarah cards**, and **no provider integrations**.

### Field Signal to Date (Hajj-peak test, June 5–13, 2025; Makkah)

- **Ad spend:** $59.28
- **Paid installs:** 40 (Men 31 @ $1.32 CPI; Women 9 @ $2.01 CPI) → overall CPI ≈ **$1.48**
- **Organic installs during campaign:** 28
- **Total installs during campaign:** 68 → **blended ≈ $0.87/install**
- **Cumulative installs to Aug 11, 2025:** **91** (Paid 40, Organic 51)
- **Implied virality (K):** **0.70** during campaign; **≈1.28** cumulative
- **Geo mix (n=91):** ME/India 55; APAC 20; USA/Canada 14; Europe 1; LatAm/Caribbean 1
- **Play Store:** 12 fully organic, founder-led installs

**Takeaway.** Even without analytics or AI, early adoption showed **healthy blended cost** and **encouraging organic pickup** in a pilgrimage context.

### What we are testing and how

- Controlled release in early December of an offline-first app focused on trust and guidance (no in‑app bookings, no manual/concierge operations).
- Feature set under test:
  - Ritual Mode (step cards, lap counter),
  - Dua Journal, content‑only Ziyarah/Local guidance cards, and
  - Optional RAG (Retrieval‑Augmented Generation) Q&A with citations if production‑ready.
- Methods and instrumentation:
  - Trip‑anchored analytics keyed to TripID (privacy‑safe cohorts).
  - Activation tracking with clearly defined core actions; same‑session Map Return Rate.
  - Live vs Pre/Post ritual usage classification to understand when guidance is used.
  - A/B placement of citation and endorsement UI to drive trust (source_view).
  - Moderated usability sessions (n = 20) for Ritual Mode task completion and clarity.
  - Channel micro‑tests with modest paid spend to benchmark CPI (Cost Per Install) and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) to Activation.
- Governance and quality safeguards:
  - MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with accredited institute; scholar‑approved content with visible citations and a refusal policy for out‑of‑scope questions.
  - Offline fallback to Ritual Mode for any network‑dependent flows.

### Timeline for testing (4‑week controlled release)

- Week 0 (prep): Finalize RAG/text guidance (if ready), analytics schema, and localization; sign MoU with accredited institute.
- Week 1 (launch): Release to controlled cohort; begin trip‑anchored tracking and gate monitoring.
- Weeks 1–2 (trust/usability): Run 20 moderated usability sessions; A/B test citations/endorsements; tune onboarding to lift Activation.
- Weeks 2–3 (channels/iteration): Run channel micro‑tests; refine copy and content; optimize for Map Return Rate and source_view without harming Activation.
- Week 4 (gate review): Go/Iterate decision and a memo summarizing gates, directional metrics, and next steps. Deliver Reporting Pack (gates with n, directional metrics, governance status, feature signals)

### Expected cost (this phase, USD)

- Paid acquisition micro‑tests: ~$1500
- Localization and content QA: ~$1,500
- Scholar honoraria/governance: ~$1,500
- Analytics/tooling (Firebase/Amplitude tier) and infra: ~$400
- AI Development Tools: ~$1000
- Development Cost:~$15000
- Contingency/miscellaneous: ~$500
- Estimated total: ~$25000

### What success looks like (metrics, gates, and decision rules)

- Must‑hit gates (trust‑first)
  - Activation: ≥40% of users complete ≥3 core actions in 14 days (n ≥ 50). Core actions: {ritual_start, ritual_finish, map_opened, poi_saved, phrase_audio_played}.
  - Ritual task success: ≥95% error‑free completion in moderated usability sessions (n ≥ 20).
  - Trust NPS (Net Promoter Score): ≥30 among active users (n ≥ 30).
  - Source_view rate: ≥25% of guidance sessions open at least one citation/source.
  - Engagement proxy: same‑session Map Return Rate ≥30%.
  - Stability: crash‑free sessions ≥99% (with emphasis on low‑end Android).
  - Safety (if RAG is active): harmful outputs = 0; ≤5% ambiguous answers resolved within 24 hours.

- Directional, non‑gating indicators
  - CPI (Cost Per Install) within ±25% of $1.48; K (viral coefficient) ≥0.70.
  - Time‑to‑first‑action ≤60 seconds median.
  - Language tools CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) ≥4.3/5.
  - Retention (Day‑14): ≥30% (n ≥ 50).

- Decision rules
  - Go (scale content; prep monetization tests): all must‑hit gates are achieved in the first controlled cohort (respecting n thresholds). Proceed to expand content, finalize governance, and prepare post‑trust experiments (pricing/monetization in later phase).
  - Iterate (tighten trust/UX): if any single gate misses by ≤20% with identifiable fixes. Example fixes: shorten onboarding to lift Activation; surface citations earlier to raise source_view; refine retrieval/chunking to reduce ambiguity; retitle POIs/cards to improve Map Return Rate. Re‑run gates after changes.
  - Pivot (content model): if harmful outputs persist or Trust NPS remains <0 despite fixes. Shift to curated, scholar‑controlled guidance (no RAG answers), maintain instrumentation, and reassess AI later.
  - Fallback (business model): if self‑guided usage/Activation remains below gate after two iterate cycles or a confirmation test, realign toward agency‑curated flows, a package marketplace, and OTA (Online Travel Agency) distribution; if licensing is blocked, distribute via licensed partners.

Note: Gates are trust‑first and non‑transactional, consistent with Section 8. CPI/K/Retention are directional to inform channel and sequencing, not to trigger Go/No‑Go in this phase.

### Minimal Instrumentation (production)

- **Core:** `trip_start` (TripID, type, est_length, language), `trip_day_heartbeat` (first key action per day, key_action), `checklist_step`, `checklist_complete`
- **Timing tags (for Live vs Pre/Post):** timestamps on `step_open` and `checklist_complete` to compute classification windows (≤2m, >60m, after-complete)
- **Cards:** `card_open` (type=ziyarah/local, site_id/topic, offline y/n), `card_dwell_ms`
- **RAG:** `rag_query`, `rag_answer_shown` (source_ids), `answer_feedback`
- **Dua:** `dua_journal_open`, `dua_created` (preset/custom), `dua_view`, `dua_edit` (with trip/post-trip flag)
- **Trust & Feedback:** `source_view`, `endorsement_view` (if present), `nps_submit`
- **Acquisition:** `install_source`, `campaign_id`
- **Stack:** Firebase (+ BigQuery) or Amplitude; offline queueing; no PII

### Hypotheses in scope (narrative + decision signals)

- H1 — Problem–solution fit (peak conditions): pass if ≥50% of new signups complete a key action in first session; track Trust NPS ≥30 among active users (≥40 stretch).
- H1a — Live vs Pre/Post ritual usage: if Live / (Live + Pre + Post) <10% and Pre dominates → prioritize pre‑Umrah micro‑lessons; if Live ≥30% → invest in both live ritual UX and micro‑lessons.
- H1b — Ziyarah/Local card utility (TripAdvisor‑like signal): ≥50% of trip‑active users open ≥2 cards; median time‑on‑card ≥20s; expand content if high (self‑guided, no bookings).
- H6 — Guidance accuracy and safety (RAG + citations): harmful outputs = 0; ≤5% ambiguous answers resolved ≤24h; source_view ≥25%; sampled CSAT ≥4.3/5.
- H11 — Brand credibility and endorsements: MoU signed; Taibah‑approved content live with citations; source_view and endorsement_view show engagement.
- H4 — Acquisition efficiency and repeatability: benchmark CPI within ±25% of $1.48; report CAC→Activation by channel; track K ≥0.70 (directional).
- H6a — AI vs human‑verified preference: if <20% of actives use RAG and source_view remains high → emphasize curated answers; treat AI as secondary.
- H1c — Dua module behavior: observe preset vs custom usage; if post‑trip revisits ≥20% of dua creators → explore light habit features.

### Out of scope for this cycle (deferred)

- H3 (Willingness to Pay/take‑rates); H2/H8/H10 (marketplace liquidity, escrow, supply‑side economics); H12 (OTA adjacency).
- Transactions and manual/concierge operations remain out of scope until trust/content KPIs are reliably met.

## Section 10 — Pivot Plan

### Scope anchor

We shipped an offline-first **Umrah Ritual Guidance + Dua Journal** MVP. Before early December we will add **search over vetted sources with citations (RAG)** and **trip-anchored analytics**, governed by an **MoU with Taibah Institute** (Taibah approves what goes in; we implement). This plan defines how we will pivot if December signals are weak and the guardrails we are putting in place against company-ending risks.

---

### Backup hypothesis (if the MVP fails)

**Pre-Umrah Trainer.** If live, in-ritual usage is weak in peak conditions, We will shift the product’s core value from “live help during Tawaf” to **pre-trip preparation**: short, structured lessons (Duolingo-style), printable/checklist packs, and curated scholar-approved content under the Taibah MoU. Ritual checklists and the Dua Journal remain; the emphasis moves to “arrive prepared and confident.” Distribution leans on imams, group leaders, and agencies.

### Alternative segment

**Imams and group leaders who run Umrah groups** (Bangladesh/Malaysia/Indonesia + diaspora). They want standardized, cited materials to give pilgrims pre-trip and light, opt-in progress signals during the journey. This segment already spends on training/materials and has clear willingness to adopt tools that reduce confusion.

---

### Pivot triggers (explicit)

- **Pre-Umrah Trainer:** Live Usage Ratio **<10%** (vs Pre/Post) despite UX improvements.
- **Curated Companion (no RAG):** any harmful output, or trust stays low (**NPS < 0**) after fixes.
- **Agency-Led Edition:** activation **<25%** after a confirmation test.
- **Partner-only OTA:** Umrah license remains out of reach; sell via licensed agencies until licensing is viable.

---

### what we will watch for (feature-direction signals)

- **Live vs Pre/Post usage** in Tawaf/Sa’i → direction of investment (live UX vs pre-trip lessons).
- **Ziyarah/Local cards** (content-only) → if ≥50% of active travelers open ≥2 cards with healthy dwell time, expand toward a **TripAdvisor-like** layer.
- **AI (RAG) usage** → if <20% of actives use RAG while **source-views** remain high, prioritize **curated** answers.
- **Dua behavior** → preset vs custom; any **post-trip revisits** may justify light habit features.

    **Guardrail:** scope freeze for the sprint; daily “must-ship” list; recovery buffer post-launch.

---

### High-priority mitigation program (cross-cutting)

1) **Trust & safety first:** Taibah MoU, citations everywhere, refusal-first RAG, 24-hour review, curated kill-switch.
2) **Trip-anchored analytics:** minimal, reliable telemetry to learn from December even at small scale.
3) **Activation discipline:** ≤60-second onboarding, auto-start first action, localization.
4) **Offline reliability:** small packs, staged rollouts, low-end Android testing, crash-free target ≥99%.
5) **Capital efficiency:** concentrate spend on Umrah peaks, lean ops between peaks, B2B pilots to diversify revenue.

---

### Alternate ideas (for future optionality)

1) **Taibah Companion (B2B/B2C):** scholar-curated prep app + printable packs; license to agencies/imams; optional consumer prep module.
2) **Group Leader Console (B2B):** distribute checklists/reminders; view opt-in milestones; reduce on-trip confusion.
3) **Masjid Prep Kits (B2B2C):** turnkey workshop (slides + QR packs) ahead of Umrah peaks to drive organic installs.

---

## Section 11 — Final Go/No-Go Decision

### Our call (concise)

**GO - We proceed with confidence based on validated demand and clear execution path.**
Idea Type B — Clear problem + weak/outdated solutions.

---

### Why now (signals so far)

- **Real need + shipped product.** 30+ interviews consistently surfaced clarity/trust gaps; our offline-first MVP (ritual checklists + dua journal) is live.
- **Efficient acquisition under peak stress.** Hajj-peak test (Jun 5–13, 2025): spend **$59.28** → **40** paid installs (**CPI ≈ $1.48**), **28** organic during the same window (total **68**); cumulative to Aug 11: **91** installs; implied virality **K ≈ 1.28**.
- **Risks are governable.** Scholar MoU in motion, citations by default, refusal policy, curated kill-switch; explicit pivot doors if live usage or trust underperform.

---

### What “GO” means for us

We will deploy pre-seed to:

- **Trust & governance:** execute the **Taibah MoU** and ship a cited, scholar-approved Top-100 corpus; refusal-first policy with a curated kill-switch.
- **Measurement:** ship **TripID analytics** (Activation, source-view, K, crash-free) and verify on low-end Android.
- **Distribution:** reconfirm CPI/K with capped micro-bursts while we build imam/agency cohorts and white-label options.

---

### Decision gates (funding milestones we’ll report against)

| Gate             | What must be true              | Evidence / Target                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trust**        | Scholar governance is in force | Taibah MoU executed; Top-100 approved content live with citations; **0** harmful outputs in audit |
| **Activation**   | First-session value is obvious | **≥40%** complete a key action (start a checklist step or create a dua); crash-free **≥99%**      |
| **Distribution** | Paid + organic are repeatable  | CPI **$1.11–$1.85**; virality **K ≥ 0.70** via community channels                               |
| **Direction**    | Live vs Pre/Post is clear      | **Live Usage Ratio ≥30%** → invest in live UX; **<10%** → prioritize **Pre-Umrah Trainer**        |

### Pre-committed pivots

- **Live <10%** → **Pre-Umrah Trainer** (micro-lessons + printables).
- **Any harmful output / NPS < 0** → **Curated Companion** (no RAG answers; fully cited, scholar-controlled content).
- **Activation <25%** after fixes → **Agency-Led Edition** (white-label via imams/agencies).

---

### Investor lens (balanced view)

- **🚩 Red flags to watch:** (1) Scholar MoU execution & review bandwidth; (2) licensing/partner dependencies for OTA/marketplace; (3) episodic usage may cap LTV without B2B/licensing.
- **✅ Excitement factors:** (1) Efficient early acquisition with organic carry at Hajj peak; (2) uncommon trust architecture (citations, refusal policy, curated kill-switch); (3) a telemetry-tied pivot map (Live vs Pre/Post, card dwell, RAG adoption, dua revisits).

---

### Immediate next steps (first tranche)

1. **Seal Taibah MoU** (scope, citation style, correction SLA, logo usage).
2. **Ship minimal analytics** (Activation, source-view, K; crash-free ≥99%); low-end Android QA.
3. **Run a capped micro-burst** to reconfirm CPI band and organic carry with new creatives.
4. **Rehearse safety & comms** (refusal defaults, curated kill-switch drill, takedown SOP).
5. **Stand up partner lanes** (imam/agency cohorts; lightweight white-label pack).

---

**Bottom line:** we proceed with **GO**, release funds against these gates, and treat December as a validation **stage to fine-tune direction**, not as the go/no-go determinant.

### Appendix K — Stickiness & Seasonality Metrics

Metric definitions (precise)

Key event: any of {ritual_start, ritual_step_completed, ritual_finish, map_opened, poi_saved, service_booked, phrase_audio_played}.

MAU(t): unique user_id with ≥1 key event in the trailing 28 days ending day t.

WAU(t): unique user_id with ≥1 key event in the trailing 7 days ending day t.

Trip-active user: a user with a TripID whose date range overlaps the MAU window.

Trip-Active MAU/WAU: MAU/WAU computed only over trip-active users.

Global WAU/MAU (T3M median): take the monthly WAU/MAU ratio for each of the last 3 complete 28-day windows; report the median.

Targets

Trip-Active WAU/MAU ≥ 0.60 (stretch 0.70) — measures in-trip stickiness without penalizing off-season users.

Global WAU/MAU (T3M median) ≥ 0.30 (stretch 0.35) — portfolio-level floor across seasonality.

Supporting seasonality metric (recommended)

Trip-Day Penetration (TDP): median over trips of
active_trip_days ÷ trip_length_days
where active_trip_day = a day in the trip window with ≥1 key event.
Target: ≥ 65% (stretch ≥ 75%).

Measurement notes

Timezone normalize to user’s local or app default; de-dupe by user_id.

Include offline-queued events once synced; exclude deleted/QA accounts.

If a user has no TripID, they’re excluded from Trip-Active metrics but included in Global metrics.

When trips span >28 days, they still count as trip-active if any day overlaps the window.
