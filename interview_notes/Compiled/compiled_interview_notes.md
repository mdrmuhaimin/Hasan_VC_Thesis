# 01. Abdul Muhid

## # Interview Notes:

Here are the detailed meeting notes from the interview with Abdul Muhid:
Background Information
• Trip Type(s) & Year(s): Abdul Muhid has performed Hajj twice.
    ◦ First Hajj: 2007, with his parents.
    ◦ Second Hajj: 2024, on behalf of his father-in-law (who passed away) and with his mother-in-law.
    ◦ He performed Umrah during Hajj on both occasions but has not travelled separately for Umrah.
• Group Size: Not explicitly stated for his trips, but he refers to general "pilgrims" and "groups" he was part of.
• Professional Background: Abdul Muhid is a Procurement Officer at a company called Super Engineering.
Journey / Context
• Planning Approach:
    ◦ He did not take any formal online courses for Hajj preparation.
    ◦ He was mostly dependent on the mentoring and coaching provided by the agency he travelled with for his recent (2024) Hajj.
    ◦ He read various books, specifically mentioning a "very thin book" on Hajj by Khandaker Abdullah Jahangir (Rahimahullah), which he found beneficial for its logistical information (e.g., patience at the airport, how Hajj might be spoiled) rather than just rulings or pillars.
• Agency or DIY Details:
    ◦ For his first Hajj in 2007, his father chose the agency as Abdul Muhid was young, although already an adult.
    ◦ He can compare the agencies from 2007 and 2024. The first agency followed a manhaj (methodology) associated with milad qiyam (religious gatherings) and would continuously play nashids (religious songs) on the bus during long journeys (e.g., 4-5 hours from Makkah to Madinah), which was exhausting for older pilgrims. The more recent agency (2024) did not have these issues.
    ◦ He learned that it's "important to know their [agencies'] manhaj [methodology/way] and their experiences" when choosing an agency, as many pilgrims in Bangladesh mistakenly rely on references (e.g., "my uncle's friend") or focus solely on money and relationships, rather than considering the agency's support, responsiveness, problem-solving capabilities, capacity, and knowledge of Saudi rules and regulations.
    ◦ The agency for his 2024 Hajj provided courses, and their "eagerness was less for the money and more for educating their pilgrims regarding Hajj and its management," which greatly aided him.
    ◦ Their training sessions were live; for those in Chittagong (like Abdul Muhid), they were conducted via Zoom or YouTube Live, with recorded videos provided afterwards.
    ◦ He believes "live training is definitely necessary," especially considering that for many middle-class or rural/small-town individuals in Bangladesh, Hajj is their first time travelling outside their village/country. He feels "physical training is definitely more beneficial than online training" for such pilgrims.
• Travel Experience (Makkah to Madinah / Independent Travel):
    ◦ His two Hajj experiences (2007 and 2024) were "really different" due to the Saudi Hajj systems changing "day by day, every year".
    ◦ He attempted independent sightseeing once, visiting Ta'if, but it became an issue because they did not have the Nusuk card (which was being delivered on that day). He noted that the Saudi government restricts pilgrims to specific buses and locations and does not allow everyone to transport pilgrims. He heard of pilgrims getting stuck due to restrictions.
    ◦ He was advised to either travel with the agency or, if going independently, to inform agency staff.
    ◦ There are also restrictions and specific timings for entering and exiting the Haram, which require knowing specific routes and rules/regulations, often available via apps.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Financial Management: While Hajj involves a "huge cost" paid in installments, Abdul Muhid's agency for 2024 was more focused on pilgrim education than on money.
• Service Delivery & Logistical Hurdles:
    ◦ Agency Manhaj: The agency from his first Hajj followed a methodology that led to "unnecessary" acts during rituals and continuous nashids on buses, which exhausted pilgrims.
    ◦ Information Gaps: Small details like knowing whether to purchase a physical SIM or eSIM can become a major issue requiring agency intervention.
    ◦ Finding Services: Difficulty in finding good restaurants around Makkah (Misflah, Aziziya).
    ◦ Language Barrier: He observed other pilgrims struggling with language, finding it difficult to communicate, ask prices, or understand Arabic visiting cards.
    ◦ Haram Access & Rituals:
        ▪ Challenges with entering and exiting the Mataf (area around the Kaaba for Tawaf).
        ▪ Specific rules and timings (e.g., Tawaf stops before Maghrib prayer) and blocked roads.
        ▪ Difficulty in finding nearest washrooms/ablution facilities if wudu breaks during Tawaf.
        ▪ Forgetting Tawaf circuit counts.
    ◦ Wheelchair Management: A "syndicate" exists for wheelchair rentals, leading to pilgrims being "cheated" on prices (e.g., paying 200 Riyals for something that should cost 70 Riyals).
    ◦ Mina/Arafat Facilities: "Toilets are very crowded and they can't find toilets" in Mina/Arafat.
    ◦ Navigation: Pilgrims often lose their tents in Mina/Arafat.
    ◦ Personal Comfort & Distraction:
        ▪ During Arafat, he was disturbed by someone praying very loudly nearby.
        ▪ Pilgrims face challenges with sacrificing personal comforts related to toilets and bedding, which can affect their focus on du'a. He noted that people get distracted by various things, including food, washrooms, and umbrellas, in Arafat.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• General App Features:
    ◦ An app that includes:
        ▪ Training for Hajj.
        ▪ Advertisements for various agencies.
        ▪ Verified pilgrim reviews for agencies.
        ▪ Detailed Hajj and Umrah ritual guides.
        ▪ Significance of sightseeing places (e.g., Ta'if, Madinah).
    ◦ Such an app would allow pilgrims to become "independent" of agency staff for minor details.
    ◦ Information should be available "at a glance".
• Specific App Features:
    ◦ Logistical Information:
        ▪ Guidance on where to get mobile SIMs (e.g., eSIM vs. physical SIM) or what to do after landing at Jeddah airport.
        ▪ Recommendations for good restaurants.
        ▪ Conversational Arabic phrases and words to help with language barriers during shopping and interactions.
    ◦ Haram & Ritual Aids:
        ▪ Information on "nearest toilet" or wokhana (washroom) locations and routes near the Mataf.
        ▪ An automatic Tawaf/Sa'i counter in the app (preferred due to crowded Mataf). If not automatic, a manual counter with plus/minus/undo options would be beneficial.
        ▪ Transparent wheelchair pricing (e.g., for Tawaf or Sa'i) to prevent pilgrims from being overcharged.
    ◦ Mina/Arafat Navigation: A Hajj map (especially for Mina) indicating routes to toilets, shops, and for tracking lost tents.
    ◦ Du'a Support:
        ▪ While du'as and rituals are available in books, an app can include them by default.
        ▪ A customizable "du'a note" or list section with options to list specific needs (e.g., for self, parents, specific illnesses, financial issues), allowing pilgrims to prepare a personalized du'a list beforehand and access it easily during Hajj, especially during Arafat. He personally believes this would have greatly benefited him.
        ▪ An AI-powered chat engine that crafts du'as by incorporating Quranic verses/Hadith (e.g., using Allah's names like Al-Razzaq, Al-Hadi, Al-Mujib for specific requests) and adding praise for Allah and salawat on the Prophet, as well as enabling users to add their good deeds as wasilah. Abdul Muhid believes this feature would be "better and beneficial".
    ◦ Support & Community:
        ▪ A "support group" or "Islamic support group" within the app where pilgrims can connect, share, and receive encouragement, especially if feeling down.
        ▪ This could include motivational verses or live streams of inspirational quotes from Sheikhs.
    ◦ Distraction Management: A warning system in the app that alerts pilgrims if they are excessively using their phone for non-app (entertainment/social media) purposes during critical times like Arafat, but not if they are actively using the Hajj app for worship or beneficial purposes.
• Post-Hajj Engagement: He strongly believes the app's activities should "definitely" be extended for the post-Hajj period. He desires for "conversations about Hajj continue always" and to keep the "essence of Hajj" and memories (e.g., walking in Misfalah, going to Haram, Arafat) alive within a community of pilgrims.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "The problem is that Hajj agencies are not interested. This is because they have a challenge: their pilgrims' data might be leaked."
• "You should do something like a B2C portal, like Booking.com, where agencies can come and sell packages. We would be interested in that."
• "it's important to know their [agencies'] manhaj [methodology/way] and their experiences".
• "their eagerness was less for the money and more for educating their pilgrims regarding Hajj and its management".
• "I believe live training is definitely necessary."
• "physical training is indeed necessary... Hajj becomes such a journey for them that it's their first time leaving the village, and that too, to a different country, a different city, and a different environment."
• "If there is such an app... through which I can become independent".
• "These minor details... if this information is available together... it becomes convenient. Then I don't have to depend on the agency staff for such small matters."
• "language [is an issue]... So, if someone can learn some conversational sentences, or conversational words, some phrases, it becomes convenient for them."
• "The challenge I face during Tawaf and Sa'i is entering and exiting the Mataf... if wudu [ablution] breaks, you have to go a long way to perform wudu. You can't find specific routes."
• "Countdown. Many times, people forget whether they have completed two circuits or three, leading to confusion... if the mobile app has an automatic [counter]... it would be helpful."
• "Because there are many types of syndicates or such things [for wheelchairs], people get cheated. Later they realize, 'I could have gotten this for 70 Riyals, why did I pay 200 Riyals here?'"
• "The common problem for pilgrims, of course, that toilets are very crowded and they can't find toilets."
• "The real hassle of Hajj, from what I observed among pilgrims, is that pilgrims usually practice du'as... However, I have seen that when they go there, people struggle with managerial and logistical issues, especially those from our country who travel less."
• "just focusing on the du'a and managing other things as best as possible, then I think it will be better because Allah will accept du'a on that one day, Inshallah."
• "it would have been beneficial for me, for Abdul Muhid, if such a thing existed [custom du'a list/notes]".
• "it would be better and beneficial if this [AI-crafted du'as using Allah's names] is included".
• "My observation is that people expect things to be free as much as possible; I saw a high expectation for free things."
• "Like, if I can spend 8 lakh or 10 lakh Taka to go for Hajj, why wouldn't I spend 1000 Taka to make my Hajj a little better? I might think that way then."
• "Definitely, for those who truly love Hajj, who truly feel Hajj... I wish that conversations about Hajj continue always."
Other Observations
• Saudi Systems: The systems and regulations for Hajj in Saudi Arabia are constantly changing, "day by day, every year".
• Pilgrim Profile: Many pilgrims from Bangladesh, especially from middle-class families or rural/small towns, embark on Hajj as their first experience travelling outside their immediate environment. This makes physical guidance and logistical support crucial for them.
• Comfort vs. Worship: Abdul Muhid highlights the importance of letting go of personal comfort expectations (e.g., specific toilet types, bedding) during Hajj, especially on the Day of Arafat, to avoid distractions and fully focus on du'a.
• Expectation of Free Services: In Chittagong, and generally in Bangladesh, there is a strong "expectation for free things" when it comes to services and products.
• App Monetization: While Abdul Muhid personally states he might not initially purchase a paid subscription for an app, he acknowledges that his "perspective might change" during Hajj, especially when considering the significant overall cost of Hajj (e.g., 8-10 lakh Taka) versus a small additional cost (e.g., 1000 Taka) to enhance the Hajj experience. This indicates that perceived value and impact on the Hajj experience can influence willingness to pay, especially given the substantial investment pilgrims already make.
• Post-Hajj Connection: There is a strong emotional desire among pilgrims to maintain the "essence" and memories of Hajj even after returning, suggesting a need for a platform that facilitates continued conversation and community among those who shared the sacred journey.
• Emotional Tone: Abdul Muhid's responses are thoughtful and detailed. He is eager to provide insights that could be beneficial, even apologising for being verbose. His suggestions reflect a deep understanding of the practical difficulties faced by pilgrims and a desire for tools that enhance the spiritual experience by reducing logistical burdens.

# 02. Abdullah Hasan

## # Interview Notes:

Here are detailed meeting notes from the interview with Abdullah Hasan:
Background Information
• Role and Experience: Abdullah Hasan is a mobile app developer and founder of Muslims. He has performed both Hajj and Umrah.
• Year(s) Performed: He performed Hajj in 2023. His Umrah trip was in February.
• Type of Trip:
    ◦ His Hajj journey was with an agency.
    ◦ His Umrah trip was undertaken with "Sabar," which provided a package that included "Seerah" classes and guidance from scholars like Qobid Anwar Bhai and Shibli Mehedi Bhai, making it more than just a typical Umrah package.
    ◦ Looking ahead, Abdullah Hasan expresses a strong preference for a 'Do-It-Yourself' (DIY) Umrah, even if accompanied by family, as he no longer finds agencies essential after two trips.
Journey / Context
• Planning and Execution:
    ◦ The Umrah with Sabar was chosen for its added value, specifically the inclusion of Seerah classes and guides, which were highly regarded.
    ◦ During his Hajj, he and his companions walked from Arafat to Muzdalifah and then to Jamarat, choosing to leave their agency due to significant delays.
• Key Decisions:
    ◦ During Hajj, a major focus was to "pray in the Haram", which meant avoiding extensive travel to distant shopping or food spots.
    ◦ He opted for the Sabar Umrah package despite a more distant hotel, prioritising the value of the included classes and the positive company of fellow pilgrims.
    ◦ For future pilgrimages, he is willing to spend more to ensure a personalised stay that aligns with his preferences, even considering travelling alone without an agency.
• Companions:
    ◦ During Hajj, the travel companions were not "similar" in mindset, which presented a challenge. His wife was also with him for Hajj.
    ◦ Conversely, during the Umrah with Sabar, the group consisted mostly of "young" people, several from the "software industry," and "every person was practicing and held good opinions of each other, and were good people," which significantly enhanced the overall experience. His child (six or seven months old) was also with him during Umrah, as were his parents. Two colleagues also accompanied him on the Umrah trip.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Accommodation and Distance:
    ◦ In Makkah, despite being promised a distance of 700-800 metres from the Haram, the location was uphill and downhill, making commuting challenging.
    ◦ In Madinah, the promised 800-meter distance turned out to be 1 kilometre, which was particularly difficult for his parents. Agencies cited high pressure at the time as a reason for not securing closer accommodations.
• Transportation:
    ◦ When choosing between a taxi/bus and a train for travel between Makkah and Madinah, the train's one-luggage limit often makes it impractical for those with more bags, necessitating taxis or buses.
    ◦ Taxis involve "uncertainty" (they might not show up) and "haggling," which can lead to variable costs.
    ◦ Ride-hailing services like Careem are "not very available in Makkah" for certain trips.
• Crowd Management:
    ◦ During his Umrah on the night of 14th Shaban (Shab-e-Barat), he encountered "more crowd than Hajj", which he attributed to locals rushing to perform Umrah.
    ◦ The severe crowding on that night forced them to stop Tawaf on the ground floor with their child after only three or four circuits and complete it on the second floor of the building.
• Communication: WhatsApp calls did not function in Saudi Arabia, necessitating the use of voice messages or Telegram for communication.
• DIY Challenges (Hypothetical): For someone going alone for the first time, Abdullah Hasan believes it would be "very challenging" due to being in a "completely unfamiliar country" with language barriers and unfamiliar roads. Specific challenges he identified for DIY travel include:
    ◦ "getting tickets".
    ◦ Navigating the "Nusuk visa" requirements, which seem to restrict visas to hotels available on their platform.
    ◦ The "risk of scam" or finding that a booked hotel is unavailable upon arrival.
• Cost Concerns: The higher cost of Sabar's package (1.5-1.55 lakh BDT) was due to the added Seerah classes and guides, suggesting that other agencies might offer closer hotels for the same price. However, he deemed the cost "fair" given the added value.
• Trust in Providers: He observed "weak management" within his Hajj agency, which had only one person struggling to manage pilgrims who did not follow instructions. He also noted management weaknesses with Sabar.
• Shopping and Food: Initially, it took "two or four days" to get acquainted with good hotels, shopping malls, and popular food spots. He found that Albaik, a popular food spot, was not easily accessible near the Haram. Furthermore, cheaper items around the Haram often came with "quite a lot of ups and downs in quality".
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Unmet Needs:
    ◦ Reliable verification of hotel bookings to prevent scams.
    ◦ Guidance on historically significant sites, popular local food, and wholesale markets that are not typically covered by standard tours.
    ◦ Easy and immediate access to religious rulings (Masail).
    ◦ Structured mental and spiritual preparation programs before the pilgrimage.
    ◦ A convenient way to acquire a SIM card for communication in Saudi Arabia (though he personally manages without one).
• Ideas for Improvement and Tools:
    ◦ DIY Umrah Support: He envisions an app that would facilitate DIY Umrah by providing Google Maps integration for navigation, ride-booking capabilities, assistance with booking tickets, connecting with Nusuk-listed hotels, and information on shuttle services from more distant 5-star hotels.
    ◦ Enhancing Spiritual Connection: An app could provide "brief history, animations, or live videos" of pilgrimage sites to help users spiritually connect with the places and the Seerah. He states he is "willing to pay for these" features.
    ◦ Ritual Checklists: A mobile app could feature a "checklist" for Umrah/Hajj rituals, including all Sunnahs and minute details, to ensure pilgrims miss nothing, especially if separated from their group. This would be very helpful as it's easier than carrying physical books.
    ◦ Masail (Religious Rulings) Support:
        ▪ He highly values a service that provides access to "live human beings, Mufti sahibs or scholars," who can offer urgent support in multiple languages for religious queries.
        ▪ While he would personally stay away from direct AI-based Masala answers, he would be comfortable with an AI acting as a "search tool" to quickly find relevant Hadith references for rulings, provided the answer is reviewed by a human Mufti.
    ◦ Pre-Journey Training: An app could offer a structured "training program" (e.g., 3-6 months) before Hajj/Umrah, particularly beneficial for senior citizens, with both live and recorded classes.
    ◦ Agency Management: There's an opportunity for technology to smooth out agency management, which he found weak in his past experiences.
    ◦ Exclusive Guided Tours: He would be interested in "exclusive service for places [he hasn't] visited but are historically famous or worth seeing," potentially offered by knowledgeable individuals (e.g., Bangladeshi students from Madinah University acting as guides).
• Pricing for App Services: He believes that for Bangladeshi users, a direct payment culture for apps is not yet developed. He suggests that payment could be integrated into agency packages. If direct payment, he considers "500 Taka" (approx. £3.30 or $4 USD) as a more reasonable and sellable price point for a valuable app, rather than 1500 Taka (£10 or $15 USD). He reasons that people already spend 400-500 Taka on physical books, so a value-adding app at a similar price could be acceptable.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "We faced more crowd than Hajj on that night." (Describing the density during Umrah on 14th Shaban)
• "But here, most of the people were young, several were from the software industry, and every person was practicing and held good opinions of each other, and were good people. Because of them, our Umrah trip, Alhamdulillah, went very well overall." (Highlighting the positive impact of companions during Umrah)
• "Even then, I would prefer to stay according to my own preferences." (Expressing willingness to pay more for comfort and personalised arrangements)
• "If I go alone, my first challenge is actually getting tickets." (Identifying a primary hurdle for DIY travel)
• "Our main goal during the Hajj journey was to pray in the Haram." (Stating the primary focus during Hajj that influenced other decisions)
• "So, I would rather prefer an exclusive service for places I haven't visited but are historically famous or worth seeing." (Indicating a specific desire for targeted historical guidance)
• "No, I think it would be very challenging." (Strongly advising against DIY for first-time pilgrims)
Other Observations
• Mindset and Preparation: Abdullah Hasan significantly attributes the ease of his journeys to his prior "mental and spiritual training" that spanned nearly a year, including reading various books and attending a three-day course. This preparation helped him manage difficult situations, such as walking 8-9 kilometres during Hajj, with a positive mindset. He believes challenges are subjective and depend on individual mindset.
• Sim Card Priority: He did not consider buying a local SIM card a high priority, successfully managing for a month during Hajj using hotel Wi-Fi and pre-planned meeting points with his wife. He doesn't see an "urgency" to pay extra for a pre-purchased SIM from Bangladesh.
• Quality vs. Cost in Shopping: His experience suggested that opting for slightly cheaper items around the Haram area often led to a noticeable "down-grade" in quality.
• Progression of Travel: He strongly advises that first-time pilgrims should always opt for an agency due to the unfamiliarity of the destination. However, after one or two experiences, he believes individuals can confidently manage a DIY pilgrimage.
• AI and Human Review: While open to AI for simple queries or as a search tool for religious rulings, he maintains a personal preference for human scholars when seeking definitive Masail. He would, however, be comfortable with AI-generated answers if they are "reviewed by a human being".

# 03. Abdullah Saleh

## # Interview Notes:

Here are detailed meeting notes from the interview with Abdullah Saleh, owner of Shepherd Agency, structured as requested:
Abdullah Saleh – Mid-Size Hajj Agency Owner Meeting Notes
Background Information
• Abdullah Saleh owns Shepherd Agency, which is described as one of Bangladesh's most reputable Hajj agencies.
• The agency has been operating in the Hajj and Umrah sector for approximately 10 to 11 years.
• From a business perspective, the agency aims to serve around 100 to 150 pilgrims annually to sustain its operations and cover salaries, with 150 being considered a "good number" for sustainability. They typically cater to "150 plus" pilgrims.
• Services offered include comprehensive Hajj and Umrah packages, which definitely include hotel, food, and transportation, as these are fundamental requirements for the packages to exist.
Journey / Context
• Customer Acquisition (Lead Generation):
    ◦ The majority of pilgrims are acquired through referrals from previous pilgrims.
    ◦ Leads also come from former pilgrims (relatives and friends) who now collaborate with the agency.
    ◦ Online campaigns, particularly on Facebook, serve as a significant source.
    ◦ WhatsApp groups of former pilgrims are also utilised for lead generation.
• Business Philosophy and Growth:
    ◦ The agency's primary focus is on ensuring a high level of service and achieving sustainable growth, rather than pursuing aggressive or "exclusive growth" targets (e.g., reaching 5,000 pilgrims).
    ◦ They acknowledge that growth is a "continuous development" driven by market demand and the steady inflow of customers.
    ◦ To maintain service quality amidst increasing pilgrim numbers, the agency is actively expanding its management.
• Collaboration with Sub-Agents:
    ◦ Individuals who collaborate with Shepherd Agency (sub-agents) are primarily motivated by "pilgrim service," aiming to please Allah through their work, rather than solely by business interests.
    ◦ The agency strives to maintain a personal relationship with sub-agents, beyond mere professional dealings. This involves spending time together, meetings, training sessions, and shared meals to foster communication and minimise gaps. This approach is reportedly appreciated by their collaborators, fostering loyalty and ensuring they work primarily with Shepherd Agency.
• Package Planning and Sourcing:
    ◦ Purchases for Hajj and Umrah services are predominantly made through Saudi online platforms, as hotel bookings are a prerequisite for visa processing.
    ◦ Initial processing involves advance bookings and submission of passport copies.
    ◦ The final package itinerary takes time to solidify, as complete information may not be immediately available.
    ◦ The agency only makes firm promises for services entirely within their control (e.g., hotel, food, transportation provision).
    ◦ For elements with some uncertainty (e.g., specific hotel name, exact meal details, or transport company), they communicate this clearly to customers, stating these are "not sure" or "uncertain". Quality, distance, and range are guaranteed, and specific details are shared once bookings are confirmed.
    ◦ To ensure service quality and verify promises (e.g., hotel star ratings), the agency often sends representatives to Saudi Arabia to physically inspect hotels and services. This involves direct engagement with hotel owners, especially for popular properties where demand may exceed supply. This in-person verification helps mitigate potential discrepancies between promised and delivered services.
• Nusuk Platform Integration:
    ◦ The Hajj and Umrah system is progressively becoming "Nusuk-dependent," meaning all processing must eventually occur through this platform.
    ◦ Hajj and Umrah visas have been online for several years, and other services, including hotel purchases, are now moving onto the Nusuk platform.
    ◦ For Hajj, payments are transferred to the agency's dedicated account on the Saudi Nusuk platform (converted to Saudi Riyals), and funds are then transferred to service providers upon online request acceptance.
    ◦ For Umrah, the direct online payment system via Nusuk is not yet fully inaugurated. Agencies currently pay hotel owners through alternative channels, while online booking documents are generated via Nusuk.
    ◦ Crucially, a Nusuk-approved hotel booking is now mandatory for visa applications for both Hajj and Umrah (effective 2025 for Umrah). Visa applications require detailed information including hotel names, entry/exit dates, and at least one transportation segment (e.g., airport to hotel).
    ◦ This increasing reliance on Nusuk means Bangladeshi pilgrims cannot easily undertake Hajj or Umrah independently and require the assistance of an agency to navigate the new, systematic requirements.
• Transportation Management:
    ◦ For Hajj, Saudi government officials manage pilgrim boarding onto pre-arranged company vehicles at the airport, guiding pilgrims based on their IDs and pre-assigned vehicles. The agency has no direct involvement at this stage.
    ◦ For Umrah, the agency now arranges company vehicles, providing drivers with specific hotel drop-off details.
    ◦ This shift to mandated company transport (via Nusuk) significantly enhances service quality and reduces issues like pilgrims getting lost or stranded at airports, as company cars offer more reliable and pre-organised service compared to random taxis.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Managing Sub-Agents:
    ◦ A primary challenge is "information gaps" or "understanding gaps" in the briefings provided by sub-agents to pilgrims, which can lead to incomplete information about Hajj or the agency's services. This necessitates the agency spending "extra time" to clarify matters with pilgrims, and in some cases, these gaps may persist.
• Scaling Custom Packages:
    ◦ The agency is not interested in working with B2C platforms that create highly customised packages based on individual customer demands.
    ◦ The rationale is that operating on such a large scale with numerous individual requirements and multiple licenses would be difficult and not sustainable with their current single-license operation.
    ◦ Individual package customisation also leads to higher prices for pilgrims, as bulk purchases offer better rates, making it difficult to maintain competitive pricing.
    ◦ Catering to a large volume of diverse, individual pilgrim requests is currently not "scalable" and presents a significant "challenge".
• Sourcing Credible Services:
    ◦ The "pyramid layer" system of hotel sales in Makkah and Madinah, combined with the Saudi government's strict and evolving regulations, presents a challenge in sourcing services.
    ◦ There is uncertainty regarding specific hotel names or service providers until final bookings are confirmed, as availability can change.
    ◦ Ensuring the actual quality of services (e.g., a "3-star hotel" being genuinely 3-star) is a constant problem in the industry, necessitating physical visits to verify quality and avoid "hiccups" after purchase.
• Nusuk Integration and Costs:
    ◦ While Nusuk improves systemisation, the new mandatory requirements for Umrah (from 2025) are leading to increased prices as agencies are compelled to purchase more "expensive" and "proper" services, with fewer loopholes for cost-cutting.
    ◦ The payment system for Umrah through Nusuk is not yet fully implemented, requiring the agency to use separate channels to pay hotel owners, complicating the process.
• Customer Satisfaction and Expectation Management:
    ◦ A significant challenge is effectively communicating to pilgrims "what they can want, what they should want, what they shouldn't want, what can be obtained, what cannot be obtained." This is deemed "the most important thing" for managing expectations in a service that is not "free" for many.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Technology Adoption (Cautious Openness):
    ◦ Abdullah Saleh expresses caution regarding adopting new software systems or AI models (e.g., an AI trained on Hajj agency data for initial customer handling).
    ◦ He states that such proposals need to be evaluated "case by case" to understand their "pros and cons, problems, issues, and challenges" before deciding. This indicates a willingness to consider technology but only after thorough assessment.
• Future Online Sourcing:
    ◦ He suggests that if the system becomes "more modern" and physical visits for hotel procurement are no longer necessary, with everything purchasable "online," it would streamline operations and benefit agencies.
• Improved Service Quality via Nusuk (Benefit/Opportunity):
    ◦ The new Nusuk-mandated system, despite leading to price increases, is expected to "ultimately improve pilgrim service" by ensuring structured and reliable transport and accommodation.
    ◦ The system aims to prevent pilgrims from being stranded or confused upon arrival, leading to a smoother experience where "pilgrims will get good service through Nusuk".
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "The main answer is through referrals. Our maximum pilgrims come through referrals from previous pilgrims."
• "So, in that regard, alhamdulillah, we are doing well. And regarding the numbers, it's a continuous development. This is, I mean, continuous development."
• "Your main focus is to ensure service level and sustainable growth." (Muhammad's summary, confirmed by Abdullah Saleh)
• "Those who work cooperatively with us, their main focus is pilgrim service."
• "This gap [information gap with sub-agents] is basically the main problem."
• "We maintain a personal level of communication with them, beyond just business or professional deals."
• "If B2C means creating packages based on customer demand, then we would not be interested."
• "Pilgrim service is important, and their welfare is important, their comfort is important."
• "As I said, it's difficult to say without understanding these things. We need to look at each thing case by case, understand its pros and cons, problems, issues, and challenges, and then we can say."
• "Up until now, the system we are using, you could call it a trial."
• "So, if I don't buy the hotel, I won't be able to get the visa. That's why we are providing the hotel, along with the food and transportation, this is certain. Without this, there will be no Hajj package; it's designed that way."
• "It's often seen that you have to go to the city area, see the hotel, understand how the hotel staff will provide service, whether what's seen in pictures is practical or different, to understand these things, you have to go."
• "Yes, these problems [misleading quality] will always exist. These always exist."
• "The more systems are applied, the fewer loopholes there are, so people are forced to buy proper, expensive things, and prices increase."
• "The system is becoming Nusuk-dependent."
• "A Bangladeshi pilgrim actually cannot do anything on their own now. If they try, they will face problems and will have to come to some Umrah agency."
• "Pilgrims will get good service through Nusuk."
• "Communicating these things [what pilgrims should expect/can get] to them, we believe, is the most important thing."
Other Observations
• Industry Trends – Increased Systematisation: The Saudi government is actively implementing strict rules and digitising Hajj and Umrah services through platforms like Nusuk. This involves mandatory pre-booked hotels and transportation through specific companies, moving away from previous looser arrangements.
• Shift in Sourcing Model: There's a transition from a multi-layered hotel selling structure to a more direct, Nusuk-dependent intermediary model. Nusuk is becoming the central platform for transactions between hotels and agencies.
• Decreased Pilgrim Autonomy: The comprehensive and mandatory nature of the Nusuk system significantly reduces the ability of individual Bangladeshi pilgrims to arrange their Hajj or Umrah journeys independently. Agencies are becoming indispensable for navigating these regulations and securing visas.
• Importance of Agency Reputation: Despite the centralisation through Nusuk, the reputation and reliability of the Hajj/Umrah agency remain critical. Pilgrims must ensure their chosen agency adheres to the new rules and is reputable, as bypass attempts can put pilgrims at "risk".
• Managing Customer Expectations: A recurring theme is the necessity of managing pilgrims' expectations about what services they will receive and what is feasible within the Hajj/Umrah framework. This communication is vital for customer satisfaction and positive referrals.

# 04. Abdur Rahman

## # Interview Notes:

Here are detailed meeting notes from the interview with Abdur Rahman, exploring common pilgrim difficulties and opportunities for improvement:
Background Information
• Pilgrim's Name: Abdur Rahman.
• Role: Canboard staff and mosque attendant.
• Pilgrimage Type(s): Abdur Rahman has performed Hajj only, stating he has never been for Umrah.
• Year(s) of Hajj: He performed Hajj three times, in 2010, 2016, and 2024.
• Cost of Hajj:
    ◦ 2010: 2 lakh 30 thousand Bangladeshi Taka (BDT).
    ◦ 2016: Around 1 lakh 60-70 thousand BDT.
    ◦ 2024: This Hajj was performed as a "Badali Hajj" (Hajj by proxy) for someone else, and the full cost of 6 lakh BDT was covered by that person.
• Group Size: In 2010, his Hajj group consisted of 86 people. He noted that his groups included many young pilgrims, aged 22, 26, 30, and 50 and under.
• Age: Abdur Rahman is currently over 60 years old.
Journey / Context
• Agency Involvement:
    ◦ Abdur Rahman used separate agencies for each of his three Hajj journeys.
    ◦ He found the service of each agency to be good.
    ◦ For two of his Hajj trips (2016 and 2024), he travelled with an agency led by someone he had known since childhood. This individual had been leading Hajj pilgrims for 20 years and had served as a Tarawih prayer leader at Abdur Rahman's mosque for 19-20 years. This particular agency delivered on promises regarding hotel and car arrangements.
    ◦ The first agency he used (in 2010) did not provide transportation, offering only two meals daily.
• Accommodation:
    ◦ In 2010, his accommodation was somewhat distant from the Haram, located near the Mezphala Bridge and Keduya Bridge. Other government pilgrims were also housed in the same building.
    ◦ In 2024, he stayed very close to the Haram, specifically behind the Zamzam Tower at Areezul Fala Hotel.
• Communication with Pilgrims by Agency:
    ◦ The agency communicated plans and instructions in a dedicated hall room or a large dining room, where all pilgrims would gather for consultations.
    ◦ Leaders (a president, vice-president, and a person managing the president's duties) would inform pilgrims about daily activities and rituals.
    ◦ WhatsApp or mobile apps were not used for agency communication, as Abdur Rahman and his group did not perceive them as necessary.
    ◦ Information spread primarily through word-of-mouth among pilgrims, often during prayer times when everyone was gathered. They would be informed about meal times and meeting locations.
• Activities and Shopping: The agency guide facilitated sightseeing trips to various places. Pilgrims were free to shop as they wished, with a strict 50kg luggage limit. Shopping was done in both Madinah and Makkah.
• Mobile Phone Use by Abdur Rahman:
    ◦ In 2010, he used a button phone.
    ◦ For his later Hajj trips (2016, 2024), he used a smartphone.
    ◦ He did not use his smartphone for Hajj-related apps or videos (such as Du'a apps, YouTube guides, or ritual instructions).
    ◦ His primary use of the mobile phone was for communicating with family back home, either via calls or internet (when available). He purchased Saudi SIM cards for this purpose.
    ◦ He maintains that smartphones cause "trouble" and "disturbance" during Hajj, citing ringing during prayers as a significant issue.
    ◦ He believes that using a smartphone is a "hassle" during Hajj and suggests it is better not to use them.
• Pre-Hajj Training:
    ◦ Abdur Rahman attended a single-day in-person training session that lasted from morning until 5 PM, which included breakfast and lunch.
    ◦ He emphasised that the primary reasons for this in-person training were to get acquainted with fellow pilgrims and agency staff and to receive direct, verbal instructions on Hajj rituals. Pilgrims were also provided with Hajj guidebooks.
Pain Points / Challenges
Abdur Rahman identified five major challenges during the Hajj journey:
• 1. Stoning of the Jamarat (Kankar Mara): This was described as a "very challenging thing" due to the immense crowds from Arafat and Muzdalifah. A significant problem is the Saudi police blocking roads, forcing pilgrims to wait or take long detours, which he calls a "big problem".
• 2. Sacrifice (Qurbani) for Millions: Abdur Rahman considers the sacrifice process to be "very complicated" for the millions of pilgrims. He expressed doubts about the authenticity of sacrifices conducted through banks, suggesting that "many people lie about it, many don't believe" and some claim to have sacrificed when they haven't.
• 3. Getting Lost (for Pilgrims and Staff): Many pilgrims, especially those unfamiliar with routes, get lost during obligatory rituals (Fard), particularly in the Haram, and struggle to find their way back to Mina. He noted that lost pilgrims often cannot speak Arabic or English, exacerbating the problem. He shared an anecdote of two pilgrims who got lost after stoning and spent all day walking, arriving back at 2 AM.
• 4. Food Difficulties: Many pilgrims struggle with the local food, which they refer to as 'Khachcha'. He explained that the local cuisine often consists of Ruh fish, chicken, and other miscellaneous items, and is sweet-based, contrasting with the spicy food that people from his country are accustomed to. This difference often leads to stomach upsets, gas, and an inability to eat properly for many pilgrims.
• 5. Disturbance from Mobile Phones and Children:
    ◦ Mobile phones: Abdur Rahman stated that mobiles cause a "lot, a lot of disturbance" by ringing during prayers. He specifically highlighted people taking selfies during Tawaf and inside the Haram, including near Maqam Ibrahim during prayers, deeming it inappropriate and noting that it has become a "business". He questions the necessity of announcing one's location or prayer status on the phone when "Allah is seeing you on the spot".
    ◦ Children: Small children crying and screaming during prayers were also described as "unbearable" and distracting.
• Underlying Challenge: Lack of Patience: Abdur Rahman strongly believes that patience is the "most important thing" in Hajj. He states that "whoever has patience will be able to perform a Hajj Mabrur (accepted Hajj)," and that "Hajj is not for them" if they lack patience, citing that "Allah Himself has promised to be with the patient".
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Mobile App for Agency Communication: When Muhammad suggested using a WhatsApp or mobile app for daily agency communication, Abdur Rahman stated, "I don't think it's necessary". He added that such apps could lead to more problems due to unreliable internet or Wi-Fi connections.
• Advanced Mobile App for Pilgrim Support (proposed by Muhammad): Muhammad proposed a comprehensive app with features such as:
    ◦ Du'a and Hajj instructions in a "Do Not Disturb" mode.
    ◦ Important agency/government messages.
    ◦ Live information on crowds in the courtyard and Tawaf areas (via camera feeds).
    ◦ Sacrifice confirmation after bank payment.
    ◦ Navigation guidance, including suggestions for less crowded routes or times.
    ◦ Emergency features for lost pilgrims, including access to visa/documents, an emergency button to notify the agency, and location sharing.
• Abdur Rahman's Response to Advanced App Suggestions:
    ◦ He initially expressed doubt, saying "I don't think so," but then conceded, "if something like that exists, it can be tried".
    ◦ However, he still believes it is "easier and better to manage it on the spot, without a mobile".
    ◦ He expressed scepticism about the app's effectiveness during peak times due to extreme crowd pressure and noted that agencies often fail to answer calls even when provided with contact numbers for lost pilgrims.
    ◦ He also pointed out that Saudi officials (police) may not understand mobile phone systems or communicate effectively in English or Arabic with lost pilgrims.
• Best Solution for Lost Pilgrims: Abdur Rahman strongly suggested that the most effective solution for lost pilgrims is to rely on the Bangladeshi Hajj workers who are employed in Makkah, Madinah, Mina, and Arafat. He highlighted that these workers speak Bengali, Arabic, and sometimes Urdu/Hindi, enabling them to provide immediate assistance and accurate directions. He stated, "I have received the most cooperation from these Hajj workers; they are the best.".
• Training via Recorded Videos (proposed by Muhammad): Muhammad suggested replacing in-person training with recorded videos on an app to avoid travel hassle.
• Abdur Rahman's Response to Video Training: He rejected this idea, reiterating that the in-person training is crucial for pilgrims to meet and get acquainted with their fellow travellers and agency staff. He believes this face-to-face interaction is vital for building trust and understanding, which cannot be replicated by watching videos.
• Cheaper SIM for Communication: Abdur Rahman indicated that pilgrims would likely purchase a cheaper SIM card from Bangladesh if it allowed only calls in Saudi Arabia and was more affordable than local Saudi SIMs. This indicates that cost-effective communication with home is considered very important by pilgrims.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "No, I haven't been for Umrah."
• "The full 6 lakh Taka, so to speak."
• "No, we didn't use WhatsApp. Because we didn't feel it was necessary."
• "I don't think it's necessary."
• "As far as I understand, sometimes there's no internet, sometimes no Wi-Fi. These things create more problems and distance."
• "No, none of those were needed."
• "It's trouble, I think. Those who carry mobiles, they cause more disturbance."
• "What kind of disturbance? It rings during prayers. After that, and after that, there is a lot, a lot of disturbance."
• "The children cry and scream so loudly, it's unbearable."
• "In my opinion, from what I've seen, no matter how many apps there are, they don't let us enter on time."
• "I believe it's better not to use mobiles."
• "What happens is, people are doing Tawaf, taking selfies. Entering Haram, taking selfies... Now everyone is a 'selfie Hajj.'... This selfie thing has become a business for everyone."
• "What's the need for that? You're saying it, you're saying you're praying, Allah is seeing you on the spot, is there a need to say this?"
• "The reason for taking the training, the reason for taking the training, is twofold. One is to know who I am going with, who is going with me. First, to get acquainted and meet them."
• "Within Hajj, what I've understood in these three years, the most important thing is patience. Whoever has patience will be able to perform a Hajj Mabrur (accepted Hajj)."
• "Allah Himself has promised to be with the patient. Allah says, 'I myself am with the patient.'"
• "Throwing pebbles... This is a very challenging thing... The Saudi police block off this side, and that side, they don't let people go, they don't release them, they hold people back. This is a big problem."
• "I consider the sacrifice issue very complicated. Many people lie about it, many don't believe."
• "Many of our pilgrims got lost like this."
• "Many people struggle with food during Hajj... So many people have problems with this; they get stomach upsets, gas, and can't eat."
• "I don't think so, but if something like that exists, it can be tried."
• "For me, it's easier and better to manage it on the spot, without a mobile."
• "Many Saudis also don't understand the mobile phone system."
• "What we've thought would be best is to use the Bangladeshi Hajj workers who are employed there... I have received the most cooperation from these Hajj workers; they are the best."
• "They didn't use mobiles much. They used them this much: they went, came back to the residence, came to the hotel, went downstairs, found a Wi-Fi connection, and talked to their families."
• "When they went to Madinah, they used the app to go to Jannatul Baqi and Riyazul Jannah, but nowhere else."
• "If there's a benefit, I would buy it. I think pilgrims would want to take it if they get such a benefit, Inshallah."
Other Observations
• Perception of Technology: Abdur Rahman generally holds a negative view of smartphone use during Hajj rituals, primarily due to the distractions they cause (e.g., ringing during prayers, selfie-taking) and practical issues like unreliable network connectivity. He prioritises a focused, undisturbed spiritual experience over technological convenience for rituals.
• Emphasis on Patience: He strongly underscored patience as a crucial virtue for pilgrims, stating its direct link to achieving an accepted Hajj (Hajj Mabrur).
• Value of Personal Connection: Abdur Rahman's preference for in-person training highlights the importance he places on meeting and building familiarity with fellow pilgrims and agency staff. This fosters a sense of community and trust that he feels cannot be replicated by remote learning tools.
• Practicality over Digital Solutions: His consistent emphasis on "on-the-spot" solutions and his high regard for the assistance provided by Bangladeshi Hajj workers (who speak local languages) over mobile app-based solutions (even for emergency situations) indicates a strong preference for direct human interaction and established, reliable support systems in the chaotic environment of Hajj.
• Observation of Younger Pilgrims: Despite his personal stance on smartphone use during Hajj, Abdur Rahman noted that younger pilgrims did use mobile apps for specific purposes, such as for Du'as/Quran and for accessing certain areas like Riyazul Jannah in Madinah. However, their primary mobile phone use was for calls and accessing Wi-Fi to communicate with family. This suggests a generational difference in technology adoption during pilgrimage.

# 05. A.K.M Kamrummzaman

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Business Name and Duration: Mohammad Kamruzzaman's agency is named Travel Trick BD. The company itself has been established for three years, but Mohammad Kamruzzaman has been working in the travel trade for over 22 years.
• Services Offered: The agency's main focus is on Hajj and Umrah. While currently not offering Hajj packages, they have a substantial customer base for Umrah packages. They offer both group packages and customised individual packages for Umrah.
• Customer Demographics / Package Range: Travel Trick BD typically serves a client base that prefers premium Umrah packages with hotels located closer to the holy sites, rather than the lower-cost packages with distant hotels found in the broader market. Their minimum Umrah package starts at BDT 1.5 lakh (150,000 Bangladeshi Taka) and can go up to BDT 3.6 lakh or 3.8 lakh, sometimes reaching 4 lakh, depending on the duration (e.g., 10 days).
Journey / Context
• Booking Processes: The agency operates on a dual model:
    ◦ B2B (Business-to-Business): They communicate and offer services through other agents.
    ◦ B2C (Business-to-Consumer): They communicate directly with pilgrims.
• Vendor Relations: For hotel confirmation and visa processing in Makkah and Madinah, Travel Trick BD relies on local agents. These agents communicate with hotels to facilitate visa issuance. Mohammad Kamruzzaman considers these agents "enlisted" and reliable, having worked with them for several years.
• Sourcing Vendors: Building relationships with these agents and hotels has been an extensive process, taking eight to nine years of continuous work. There is no centralised portal to find these agents. Mohammad Kamruzzaman built connections by attending "Saudi Roadshow" programs in Bangladesh and making individual visits to Saudi Arabia to meet with hotel representatives directly. For new agencies, he suggests communicating directly with target hotels to inquire about annual rates or to get contacts for wholesale room purchases. He cautions against dealing with external companies, which can lead to payment issues without proper service delivery.
• Marketing Approach: Currently, B2B agent communication and management are handled through WhatsApp groups.
• Digital Adoption (Current and In-Progress):
    ◦ Travel Trick BD is actively developing its own B2B portal, which will allow agents to log in and access all necessary information and make purchases. This portal is under development.
    ◦ They use Excel sheets for tracking marketing leads.
    ◦ An accounting software is used for corporate client data.
    ◦ Mohammad Kamruzzaman acknowledges that their current customer management process is insufficient and is in the process of implementing a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system to manage phone and email correspondences. He believes this will solve their current customer management challenges.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Airport Logistics: A significant challenge is managing airport logistics, particularly arranging transportation upon pilgrims' arrival. While "free transfers" are often offered by representatives, they are not truly free and result in "a big amount deducted" or a "penalty" for the agency.
• Price Competition: The market has packages as low as BDT 1.25-1.3 lakh, though Travel Trick BD focuses on premium offerings.
• Customer Trust & Market Education:
    ◦ Clients in Bangladesh prefer direct communication (phone calls, in-person visits) over booking Umrah packages directly from online marketplaces. The market is "not yet educated" enough for online package selection and direct booking without human interaction.
    ◦ There is a deep-seated trust in religious leaders (Imams/Khatibs) over agencies. These religious leaders often act as group leaders, gathering pilgrims and then negotiating with multiple agencies for the lowest price, profiting from the difference.
    ◦ Pilgrims, especially from rural areas, often have no prior experience with air travel or flight rules (e.g., meal inclusions), making them "easily scammed" by unscrupulous agencies. They are often focused solely on visiting Makkah and Madinah, paying less attention to service quality.
• Regulatory Requirements / Market Syndication:
    ◦ Hajj and Umrah agencies in Bangladesh require separate licenses, meaning not just anyone can operate in this sector.
    ◦ A significant challenge is the syndication within the Hajj/Umrah market: no new agencies have been enlisted since 2015 and up to 2025, preventing new entrants and allowing existing, often large and "enlisted," agencies to engage in fraudulent practices.
• Fraudulent Practices by Agencies:
    ◦ Misrepresentation of Hajj/Umrah trips: Some agencies take large groups for Umrah during Ramadan (end of Umrah season) and then facilitate Hajj later by housing them in rented accommodations, charging inflated prices (e.g., BDT 4.5 lakh for a trip costing BDT 3 lakh).
    ◦ Hotel fraud: Large, "enlisted" agencies may show Nusuk-approved hotels for visa purposes but house pilgrims in different, unapproved hotels to secure lower rates and save costs.
    ◦ Airline meal fraud: Agencies may book airline tickets without meals to reduce costs, then provide packed food from Dhaka or Makkah/Madinah to be eaten at the airport or onboard. Mohammad Kamruzzaman explicitly states that these practices are carried out by "enlisted agencies," not small ones.
• Staffing Challenges: Agency owners are uncomfortable with their staff potentially leaving to join rival agencies. They may even impose conditions preventing staff from joining certain competitors or threaten legal action.
• Spiritual Aspect Management: Ensuring pilgrims gain sufficient knowledge, undergo proper training, and maintain focus to perform rituals like Tawaf and Sa'i correctly is "definitely challenging".
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Tech-driven Solutions:
    ◦ Mohammad Kamruzzaman was initially hoping for a third-party, dedicated software solution for B2B and B2C management with no upfront cost and a monthly subscription model, as he had to build his own system due to lack of market availability.
    ◦ He would consider a secondary service for Umrah-focused packages if it is cost-effective (commission-based or flat fee) and useful.
    ◦ He sees potential for a B2B gateway/platform for agents to compare packages and prices.
    ◦ A B2C marketplace where customers can choose hotels/flights and get Nusuk-approved hotel guidance and visa processing could democratise the market, especially if it includes a simple app in Bengali providing transparent information and human support for essential services like airport reception and Ziyarat guidance. This would be a gradual process, not an overnight change.
• Consultancy Role: Mohammad Kamruzzaman is personally comfortable acting as a consultant for a new marketplace, provided it's ethically sound and addresses market specifics. He sees no problem being part of a new marketplace as a consultant.
• Addressing Data Privacy: He acknowledges the concern among some agencies about data privacy when using SaaS solutions. A proposed solution involves the tech provider not storing client data themselves, instead connecting to the agency's own cloud (e.g., Google Drive) and keeping data encrypted or using code names, backed by a strong legal framework and NDAs. However, he notes that not all agencies are even aware of this concern.
• Marketing Improvements: An online platform could allow for better display of packages and direct communication.
• Spiritual Training Enhancement: Implementing online, regular input (e.g., "Now you will do this, after this, this will happen") and pre-trip training with small quizzes to test pilgrims' knowledge could significantly improve their spiritual experience and preparation for Hajj/Umrah rituals.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "My client base isn't at that level." (Referring to low-cost packages with distant hotels)
• "If you take that, the agency gets a big amount deducted, a penalty." (Regarding supposedly free airport transfers)
• "Our market hasn't really become educated enough yet to just look at a package and choose from there." (Explaining why B2C online marketplaces are less effective currently)
• "Yes, I was hoping for something like this initially. But since it wasn't available in the market, I had to do these things myself." (About a comprehensive third-party tech solution)
• "If we understand it initially, we create an issue that prevents us from providing them the service." (Regarding declining service for clients with ill intentions for a trip)
• "Everyone tries to have some individual control so that at least their prime base doesn't have the possibility of going into someone else's hands." (Highlighting agencies' fear of data sharing with SaaS providers)
• "Those who have never considered SaaS, for many, this whole thing will be new. But they won't even raise this question." (On varying levels of tech awareness among agencies)
• "You could say they are my enlisted agents." (Referring to the reliability of his Makkah/Madinah agents)
• "This has been going on for about eight, nine years of continuous work, and it has become something." (Describing the effort in building vendor relationships)
• "Owners would not be comfortable." (On consulting for potential rival agencies)
• "An Imam in my area will be trusted more than this agency will be trusted by me." (Explaining the deep trust in religious leaders for Hajj/Umrah matters)
• "If I tell you the truth, no one will believe me. But whatever that Hujur (religious leader) says, even if it's wrong, they will believe it." (Reinforcing the previous point on trust)
• "Some categories of people have this target. And big companies, the ones we call very big agencies, if they do number two [fraudulent acts], that's even more dangerous." (On widespread fraudulent practices)
• "This should actually be off the record." (When sharing details of fraudulent practices)
• "The enlisted agencies are doing this." (Clarifying who commits fraud)
• "This is not tourism. This is a scam." (His assessment of certain fraudulent practices)
• "They are not allowing any new agencies to get enlisted since 2015. No new agencies have been enlisted until 2025." (Highlighting market syndication)
• "It won't happen overnight. It can be done gradually." (On the feasibility of a tech-driven market democratisation)
• "If regular input can be given online, saying, 'Now you will do this, after this, this will happen. You have to do this.' This can definitely be a solution." (On spiritual guidance for pilgrims)
Other Observations
• Seasonal Trends: The busiest times for Umrah are December, January, and Ramadan.
• Operational Challenges: The existing methods for customer management (Excel, accounting software) are acknowledged as insufficient, prompting the move towards a CRM system.
• Innovation Readiness: Mohammad Kamruzzaman seems open to new tech solutions that can streamline operations and address pain points, especially since he has had to develop his own systems due to lack of suitable options in the market. However, he notes that broad market adoption of SaaS solutions might be challenging due to varying levels of tech awareness and trust issues among agencies.
• Ethical Considerations in Business: Mohammad Kamruzzaman operates with a focus on ethical, Islamic business practices. He instructs his team to refuse service if a client's travel intention is deemed "not halal" (e.g., going to party). He sees the need for a system that helps ensure halal compliance in travel, beyond just the service provision.
• Market Dynamics: The Bangladeshi Hajj and Umrah market is characterised by strong reliance on religious figures, significant price competition, and widespread fraudulent practices by established agencies, exacerbated by market syndication. There's a "huge vacuum" for agencies that can provide good, transparent service.

# 06. Ehteshamul Hakim

## # Interview Notes:

Here are the detailed meeting notes from the interview with Ehteshamul Hakim, who is planning to perform Umrah for the first time:
Background Information
• Pilgrimage Type(s): Umrah.
• Year(s): Planned within the next few months.
• Group Composition: Ehteshamul Hakim is a first-time pilgrim for Umrah. He plans to accompany his elderly parents. He expresses that if he were to perform Hajj in the future, he would want to do so with his daughter and family, not alone.
Journey / Context
• Travel Companions: His primary companions for Umrah will be his elderly parents.
• Accommodations: He seeks a balanced travel package that is decent, comfortable, and affordable, rather than luxurious or budget-only options. He considers the distance from the mosque important: not too close (as it increases cost) and not too far (as it becomes difficult). A medium-range distance (5-10 minutes walk) is preferred, but for hotels 15-30 minutes away, a reliable shuttle system is crucial. He looks for hotels that offer a good experience without causing distress regarding food or other aspects of the trip. His preferred hotel budget is 10,000 to 12,000 Taka.
• Facilities for Women: While not explicitly detailed, his desire to perform Hajj with his daughter and wife indicates a consideration for family-inclusive travel for significant pilgrimages. He previously traveled with his wife.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Safety: A significant concern is medical emergencies, especially given that elderly people will be accompanying him, and he wonders whom to contact in such situations.
• Privacy: Not explicitly mentioned as a pain point.
• Comfort: He aims for a travel experience free from "suffering". He expresses worry about hotel selection and its distance/shuttle service for his elderly parents. He also worries about potential car breakdowns or delays if relying on travel agents for transport.
• Guidance: He feels a lack of guidance on how to perform the rituals of Umrah, expressing a desire for a "complete roadmap" for worship. He notes his Arabic is weak and wonders if this will affect the validity of his Umrah or prayers.
• Travel Agent Reliability: He is wary of over-promising travel agents who may not deliver on their commitments, especially regarding hotel quality (e.g., misrepresenting 3-star hotels) and transport arrangements. He estimates that seven out of ten Bangladeshi travel agents do not provide a proper experience.
• Immigration: He expresses concern about immigration problems from Bangladesh, wishing for a smooth and soothing process.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• New Pilgrim Focused Services: He would greatly benefit from a clear, organized book providing basic information about Umrah, what to do, what to master, and what to expect, which could help remove fear. While open to mobile apps, he notes potential distractions and cultural inappropriateness of using phones inside mosques.
• Safer Transport: He values a travel agent who can handle all transport logistics (e.g., arranging specific cars and drivers for various legs of the journey like Medina to Mecca or trips to Taif) to avoid personal hassle. Travel agents should have backup plans for unexpected transport issues.
• Tailored Guidance: He highly values the presence of a live guide during the pilgrimage for "live navigation" and human interaction. He would be willing to pay extra for such a service. He finds the human-to-human interaction and the sense of urgency and organization provided by a live guide to be more effective than an AI or calendar task, even if AI can provide information. He believes a good travel agent should understand the "type of customer" they are dealing with to provide appropriate service.
• Travel Agent Selection Strategy: He prefers to draft his own detailed itinerary (including preferred destinations, hotel types, and duration) and then seek quotes from multiple travel agents (3-4) for comparison. He verifies specific details like hotel name, car model, and driver before making a choice. He is willing to pay a tolerable margin of approximately 4,000-5,000 Taka per traveler for a travel agent to manage the complexities and hassles of booking and arrangements.
• Due Diligence: To assess trustworthiness, he checks a travel agent's marketing, Facebook presence (views, reviews), and YouTube vlogs from previous travelers to gauge satisfaction and match visuals with reviews.
• Personal Preparation: Once the visa is obtained and bookings are confirmed, he plans to mentally prepare for two months prior to the trip. This includes seeking advice from friends and family who have performed Umrah, asking them about preparation methods and clarifying doubts regarding his weak Arabic skills.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "I didn't think about it much before. But now, as I'm answering you about this, I'm thinking about seeing the House of Allah tomorrow. Thinking about this makes my heart feel a certain nervousness, fear, or emotion."
• "And one of the main reasons for going to Umrah is that my parents have wanted to perform Umrah for a long time. To accompany them."
• "And I also heard that no one can see the House of Allah unless Allah wills it. So, if I feel that and if my life changes after coming back from there, I also want a change in my life."
• "However, as a Muslim, it is everyone's dream to see that House, and since my parents want to see it, I want to fulfill that dream from all perspectives."
• "If I ever perform Hajj, I will do it with my daughter or with my family. I cannot accept the idea of going for Hajj without my daughter or my wife."
• "Spiritually, I believe that performing Hajj requires a certain worthiness from a person. Whether a person is worthy of Hajj or not also matters. If I don't pray my daily prayers... and then I just go for Hajj to Allah, and Allah accepts my Hajj, it doesn't seem that easy to me."
• "This is a matter of thinking. And mainly, besides accommodation, there's the matter of worship. Yes, obviously, since I haven't done Umrah or Hajj before, even if we educate ourselves, it would be much better if there was guidance or a complete roadmap for the worship, which I don't know yet. This is something that bothers me."
• "The car broke down halfway, and it took so long for another car to arrive that their entire travel plan was ruined. So, many travel agents don't maintain these things properly, they don't keep backup plans."
• "But if someone charges 10,000-20,000 Taka more and makes the experience beautiful, then people will always remember that travel agent's name. So, I think the experience is very important here, and seven out of ten agencies in Bangladesh don't provide that."
• "I think the most, most, most important thing is the person who is dealing with this, the person who is dealing with the customer... When talking to the customer or dealing with them, they must understand what type of customer it is."
• "A mobile can actually replace it, but you have to look at this a bit differently. When you are performing Umrah, you have a mobile in your hand, and you are looking at it and doing something – that might not look good. And then, a notification might pop up... So, this distraction, I think, can exist."
• "Because many Bengalis, especially, might look at you if you're inside the mosque, using your mobile... They might suddenly look and say, 'Why are you using your mobile inside the mosque?' So, these are the things."
• "But the live experience is different... I don't think AI would be more efficient in that sense. ... Urgency and human-to-human interaction."
Other Observations
• Cultural Factors: Ehteshamul Hakim acknowledges that Saudi Arabian culture is different from that of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Western/African countries. He expresses concern about potential cultural inappropriateness if using a mobile phone for guidance inside the mosque, fearing judgment from other Bengali pilgrims.
• Gender-Specific Factors Affecting Experience: His strong preference to perform Hajj with his daughter and wife, and his inability to accept going without them, highlights a family-centric approach to major pilgrimages, implying their comfort and participation are key considerations.
• Elderly Travel: Significant attention is given to the comfort and logistical needs of his elderly parents, particularly concerning hotel proximity to the mosque and immediate access to medical assistance in emergencies.
• Affordability vs. Spiritual Readiness: Umrah is chosen now partly due to its affordability compared to Hajj. He views Hajj as a "very big event" requiring more financial and, crucially, spiritual readiness or "worthiness", which he feels he currently lacks due to his less practicing nature.
• Personal Travel Philosophy: He is an experienced traveler who typically plans his own trips. For Umrah, he seeks a balanced experience, prioritizing thorough exploration of a few key places over rushing through many. He views Umrah as a potential "life-changing event" that might bring positive spiritual change, though he remains pragmatic about the possibility of returning to his old lifestyle, as he has observed in others.
• Trust in Travel Agents: He generally relies on travel agents for security and to manage hassles, but has a low trust percentage (expecting less than 100% fulfillment) from most Bangladeshi agents, except for a few well-regarded ones like ShareTrip and GoZ.

# 07. Farhadul Alam

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Pilgrimage Type(s) and Year(s): Farhadul Alam Khan performed Hajj in 2024. He participated in a full Hajj package, remaining for the entire duration, which was approximately 40 days.
• Travel Setup: He joined Hajj from Bangladesh and travelled through an agency.
Journey / Context
• Pre-Hajj Preparation: His agency provided comprehensive Hajj-related information through various meetings, groupings, YouTube channels, websites, and Zoom meetings. They also supplied books and documents for guidance on Hajj activities and duties.
• Connectivity: Farhadul purchased a SIM card for a month in Saudi Arabia, which cost around 50 Saudi Riyals, and later extended it for 10 days at a significant additional cost. Agencies advised pilgrims not to buy SIM cards hastily at the airport but to understand options upon arrival, as a person can only register up to two SIM cards during their stay.
• Communication during Hajj: WhatsApp was the primary means of communication with the agency during the Hajj days and various events.
• Ziyarah (Visits to Historical Places): During group Ziyarah trips, only one or two team leaders were responsible for explaining historical backgrounds to large groups (40-150 people), which was often insufficient. Pilgrims often relied on drivers for transportation to these sites.
• Information Gathering on the Ground: Farhadul spent about two weeks after arriving gathering information from various people about where to find good food, bargain deals, specific markets, or places to buy gifts and dates.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Lack of Proper Training: Farhadul observed that it is "very difficult to go for Hajj without training". Many pilgrims, particularly those from rural areas, lacked proper training and knowledge, leading them to unknowingly make mistakes, perform rituals incorrectly, or even commit acts of Shirk (idolatry), casting doubt on the completeness of their Hajj. He noted that only pilgrims from Dhaka and Chittagong who were properly guided by scholars demonstrated accuracy in Hajj performance.
• Ineffectiveness of Online-Only Preparation: Completing Hajj preparation solely through recorded videos is often insufficient because "various questions arise" that require real-time answers. While online Q&A is possible, it can be time-consuming, especially with a large number of participants.
• SIM Card and Connectivity Issues: Initial SIM card purchase upon arrival could be a "hassle" and difficult. Extending SIM packages for shorter durations later became "a significant amount" of expense. During Hajj, internet "jam or blockage" could make communication difficult due to poor network.
• Limitations of WhatsApp: While WhatsApp is effective for group communication, it "cannot cover everything" and has "many drawbacks".
• Insufficient Ziyarah Experience: Pilgrims often visit historical places without knowing their background, which diminishes the importance and enjoyment of the visit. Furthermore, dependence on drivers for Ziyarah could lead to "excessive fares or exaggerated distances".
• Difficulty in Navigating Local Services: Pilgrims face challenges finding good food, bargain deals, specific markets, or places to buy local products like dates in Makkah and Madinah.
• Maintaining Post-Hajj Spirituality: After Hajj, many pilgrims "return to their old routines and busy lives," causing the spiritual aspects and memories of Hajj to "gradually fade". He noted that many are "not all very practicing Muslims," which makes maintaining the spiritual connection challenging amidst daily life.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Blended Training Approach: A combination of online and physical attendance for Hajj preparation is beneficial. Farhadul suggested attending at least 3-4 physical seminars out of 10, with the rest covered online, to facilitate question resolution.
• Third-Party Training & Real-time Support: If an agency does not provide adequate training, pilgrims should seek training from a third-party source, as it "definitely adds value". He strongly recommended training from a "knowledgeable scholar" regardless of format (online, offline, physical). He also suggested a system where pilgrims could "instantly get the answer directly through Messenger, a direct link, or any technology or IT app" for questions arising during Hajj, deeming it "very good" and "extremely helpful" due to constant internet access in Saudi Arabia during Hajj.
• Pre-arrival SIM/eSIM Packages: Offering a 2-3 day SIM/eSIM travel package from Bangladesh that can be extended in Saudi Arabia would be "definitely add value" if the price is affordable. He suggested a price point of within 10 Saudi Riyals for 2-3 days (approx. 3-4 USD) and around 20 Saudi Riyals for a 10-day Umrah package. This would allow pilgrims to settle in before choosing a full package.
• Online Hajj Courses:
    ◦ Pricing: For a comprehensive online Hajj course with 24/7 support during Hajj, a fair price would be around 10,000 to 15,000 Bangladeshi Taka (approx. 85-130 GBP), especially if taught by a renowned scholar.
    ◦ Scholar Expertise: While a renowned scholar brings "face value" and trust, Farhadul noted that a knowledgeable scholar (e.g., a graduate from Madinah University or a good Islamic university) can also provide proper guidance, as Hajj rituals are fundamental and do not require new fatwas. However, for "very specific, technical" questions, an expert scholar's opinion is preferred for pilgrim satisfaction.
• AI/Chatbot for Hajj Information: An AI/chatbot that provides authentic answers from referenced sources (e.g., specific scholars, websites) to basic Hajj questions would be "acceptable" and useful. He stressed the importance of "original source and authentication" for trust.
• Hajj Rituals App: An app featuring all Hajj rituals in a checklist format with duas, notifications for different stages (Mina, Arafat), regular prayers from authentic sources, and personal note-taking capabilities, would be "very beneficial" and "helpful".
    ◦ App Pricing: He suggested that pilgrims might pay a minimal amount (e.g., 500-1000 BDT or 500-700 BDT) for such an app, but not much more, as Hajj is typically a one-time pilgrimage for most. He asserted that if the app were free, it would have "a huge number of users".
• Interactive Ziyarah Guide: An app or guide that acts as an "interactive guide" with map-based navigation, descriptions of each site's historical significance, and detailed instructions on how to reach them (e.g., taxi, bus) would be "very helpful" for independent pilgrims. It should provide information in different languages.
• Local Business Directory/Crowdsourced Reviews: A local business directory for Makkah and Madinah with pricing, ratings, service details, and crowd-sourced reviews would be "definitely beneficial" for pilgrims, saving significant time, especially for short-term visitors.
• Hajj and Umrah Specific Communication App: A dedicated communication app with features like individual and group communication, location sharing, and event notifications (e.g., full trip itinerary, live event pop-ups like religious gatherings) would be valuable. The ability to function offline would be an added benefit due to internet jams.
• Post-Hajj Spirituality Support System: An app or system that provides regular reminders (daily, weekly, or on specific days like Fridays) with messages, spiritual reminders, and activities would help pilgrims maintain the "spirit of Hajj" long after their return. This could be similar to Azan alarms or calendar notifications.
• Pilgrim Social Networking App: A limited social networking app allowing pilgrims to connect with those they met during Hajj, share memories, and receive ongoing spiritual resources or activity notifications (e.g., weekly reminders for worship or discussions) would be a good idea.
• Building Trust for New Booking Platforms: New online booking sites offering cheaper rates can gain user trust by prioritizing marketing, promotions, extra discounts, and providing honest service to accumulate positive reviews. Initial struggle is expected, but good reviews will ultimately build trust.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "Hajj is not an easy journey."
• "Actually, it's very difficult to go for Hajj without training."
• "Because Hajj has two parts: one is logistics, and the other is performing Hajj. Performing Hajj is the complete purpose of going. And logistics means I need to have a place to stay, move around, eat, these things, in order to perform. That's a part of Hajj, but it's not a part of worship."
• "Therefore, to complete the worship perfectly, in any way possible, it's essential to get training from a knowledgeable scholar who genuinely knows how to perform Hajj, what activities to do there, how to worship, and how to complete Hajj. Whether it's online, offline, or physical, it's important to be in their company."
• "And sometimes it seems to me that this is not just pre-Hajj training. If something like this could be done where, during Hajj itself, if a situation arises or a question comes to mind, the pilgrim can instantly get the answer directly through Messenger, a direct link, or any technology or IT app or other means. In that case, it would be very good."
• "Because in Saudi Arabia, at least during Hajj time, we had constant access to IT and the internet. We could access anything anytime, in any situation. So, this is really appropriate and very helpful... not just helpful, it's extremely helpful."
• "Because many people go only for three days, a short visit just to perform Umrah and return. For them, if such a package is offered, I think it would be good. And if a week-long package is offered, that would be even better, around 20 riyals for a 10-day SIM package, that would be even better."
• "Here, there's no difference in the medicine; it's the face value." (Used in an analogy comparing doctor fees to scholar fees for Hajj guidance).
• "Because during the entire duration of Hajj, many small questions arise. It makes one think, 'Is there any problem with my Hajj? Is there any issue with my Hajj?' At that time, they want an opinion from a very good, expert, or very knowledgeable person for their satisfaction."
• "A book is like a syllabus. It contains a lot of things. When I need what, what is necessary, what I need – I have to search and find it. It's often time-consuming. And the internet is like a suggestion. What should I do in the situation I am in? Immediately, the specific thing appears there."
• "Because this app is actually a one-time thing. After Hajj, since a person usually performs Hajj only once, its utility doesn't remain for someone who has already performed Hajj."
• "The cheaper it is, the better. Of course, if it's free, then it will have a huge number of users. Many people will accept it."
• "WhatsApp is definitely effective for communication. But if something better could be found, if there was a better source, it would be even more so. Because sometimes, not everything can be covered with WhatsApp."
• "Actually, after completing Hajj, many people return to their old routines and busy lives. They go back to their old life. It's seen that then, amidst their normal busy routines, the spiritual aspects of Hajj, the things that actually happen during Hajj, gradually fade from memory."
Other Observations
• Concern for Spiritual Integrity: Farhadul's strong emphasis on proper training and his observation of pilgrims unknowingly committing mistakes or Shirk highlights his deep concern for the spiritual authenticity and completeness of the Hajj pilgrimage.
• Trust in Authority (Face Value): He acknowledged the psychological importance of a scholar's "face value" in training, suggesting pilgrims feel more secure and trusting when guided by highly respected figures, even if the core information is consistent across scholars.
• Practicality and Efficiency: His preference for online "suggestion" over a physical "syllabus" (book) for quick access to information during Hajj rituals demonstrates a pragmatic approach to managing the pilgrimage efficiently.
• Value Perception of Apps: He indicated that while new pilgrims might pay for a Hajj app due to curiosity and a desire to complete the Hajj well, repeat pilgrims (like for Umrah) would likely prefer a free app, as they already have the experience and knowledge, seeing less value in an additional cost for a one-time spiritual journey.
• Desire for Continued Spiritual Connection: Farhadul expressed a common challenge of maintaining the Hajj spirit post-pilgrimage due to returning to daily busy lives. His suggestions for app-based reminders underscore a desire for practical tools to sustain spiritual growth and connection amidst worldly engagements.

# 08. Hasan Mahmud

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information – Pilgrimage type(s), year(s), travel style.
• Name: Ataullah Hasan Mahmud.
• Age: 39 years.
• Hajj: Performed once in 2009-10 (which was actually November 2009 and end of December, creating an overlap within two months). For Hajj, he travelled through an agency.
• Umrah: Performed twice.
    ◦ His most recent Umrah was in March 2025, which he arranged completely himself (flight booking, visa through intermediary, and all other tasks).
    ◦ For his previous Umrah, he also went on his own arrangements.
Journey / Context – Planning process, companions, travel logistics.
• Planning Process:
    ◦ For his recent Umrah, Hasan Mahmud personally arranged everything to allow him to "choose his preferred time," select hotels, and "design his journey time" for maximum comfort.
    ◦ He booked hotels for Medina through Agoda. However, for Mecca, he did not pre-book from Bangladesh; instead, he physically visited hotels upon arrival to find the "best price" in the nearest position.
    ◦ For an earlier Umrah, he booked both Medina and Mecca hotels in advance, as Agoda had fewer options. He used local contacts to find and confirm hotels, paying some money from Dhaka and the remainder upon arrival.
    ◦ He noted that agencies typically provide a total combined booking cost and do not break down expenses like flight costs.
• Companions:
    ◦ For his recent Umrah in March 2025, he travelled with his child, which resulted in some discounts on flight fares.
    ◦ His first Umrah involved three people.
    ◦ He suggests that the most convenient booking method (online, self-booking on arrival, or agency) "depends on who will be travelling" with him (e.g., bachelors/solo travellers vs. family). With family, he would definitely pre-book at least the first hotel.
• Travel Logistics:
    ◦ He used Uber for some transportation but faced issues with online payment (as a Bangladeshi, he could only pay with cash).
    ◦ For visiting sightseeing spots (like Jabal Sur, mosques, Cave of Hira), he spoke to "local people" and booked taxis by agreement with them.
    ◦ He travelled from Medina to Mecca by taxi.
    ◦ He considered train service for inter-city travel but found it too expensive and inconvenient when travelling with a child, due to the additional transport needed to and from the railway stations, making taxis more preferable for his time convenience.
Pain Points / Challenges – Accommodation, transport, rituals, costs.
• Accommodation:
    ◦ Agencies often book hotels that are far from the Haram, and closer hotels are usually "more costly" when booked through an agency.
    ◦ There's a risk that agency-booked hotels might "not be to your liking".
• Transport:
    ◦ Taxis are "a bit costly" and "very costly" for pilgrims from Bangladesh, compared to other regions.
    ◦ Overall transport costs (excluding public transport) have become "very expensive".
    ◦ Uber payment issues for international transactions (online payment not possible for Bangladeshis, only cash accepted).
• Rituals:
    ◦ Hasan Mahmud prefers not to use an app for ritual guidance (like Tawaf or Sa'i) as an alternative to a book, because "other notifications often pop up, and attention also shifts" when using a device.
    ◦ Existing apps like Nusuk provide Duas, but often in Arabic or with delayed English translations.
    ◦ Pilgrims sometimes miss prayer times because the Adhan cannot be heard from hotel rooms, especially due to the time difference.
• Costs:
    ◦ Overall costs for food, taxis, and transport are "very expensive" and "increasing day by day".
    ◦ Buying a local SIM card can be "a bit difficult" at around 15-20 Riyals.
    ◦ Agency flight bookings lack transparency; they provide a combined cost, and sometimes pilgrims paying the same price might have unequal baggage allowances.
• Other Challenges:
    ◦ Arranging everything independently can be "a bit of a hassle".
    ◦ Family management: People, especially elderly individuals, can "get lost" and require communication.
    ◦ Many people are deterred from self-arranged pilgrimages due to a lack of updated guidelines and information regarding Saudi government rules and regulations, leading them to rely on agencies.
    ◦ Basic queries like "how to go from Jeddah to Mecca," "where to find a car," "how Uber works," or "where to buy a SIM" can cause pilgrims to "panic" upon arrival due to rapidly changing options and information.
Opportunities / Suggestions – Ways to improve pilgrim services and guidance.
• Comprehensive Pilgrimage App:
    ◦ An app that provides locations for Ziyarah (sightseeing), including audio/video clips or text explaining their significance ("why that place is famous, its significance"), would "definitely add value" and be "very helpful".
    ◦ It should offer itinerary plans and pre-arranged group tours.
    ◦ Include deals, discounts, and coupons for shops.
    ◦ Integrate taxi services (e.g., booking taxis with scheduled pick-up/drop-off).
    ◦ Offline "Ritual Mode" with DND: For Tawaf and Sa'i, an app could be used if it offers an offline mode with "Do Not Disturb" functionality, preventing notifications and calls during rituals, with missed notifications shown upon exiting the mode. This would make it a "more convenient" alternative to a book.
    ◦ Food arrangements for individual travellers could be facilitated through the app.
    ◦ Real-time Haram announcements: Provide national announcements from Haram (e.g., prayer times, congregational times) instantly in multiple languages (especially English), as current Nusuk announcements are often delayed or only in Arabic.
• Family Management/Location Tracking: Implement Bluetooth technology or AirTag-like features for finding lost family members, which would be "very easy" and helpful.
• eSIMs: Offer cheap eSIMs with limited data for communication (WhatsApp, Telegram, location) as an alternative to expensive physical SIMs.
• Pre & Post Hajj EdTech Platform:
    ◦ A mobile-based program (ideally starting three months before Hajj rather than six) for spiritual and logistical training.
    ◦ Should include lectures from Islamic scholars, modules, and Hajj trainers.
    ◦ Post-Hajj training (for six months) to help maintain the spiritual essence, including reminders for pledges (e.g., regular prayers, Quran reading).
    ◦ Hasan Mahmud prefers a one-time payment for such courses rather than a subscription model due to payment hassles.
    ◦ He suggests a modular pricing approach, where users can choose to pay for specific sections of the app or courses.
    ◦ For a bundled app (pre/post Hajj training, ritual guidance, Ziyarah, deals), he would be willing to pay up to 10-12 USD (approximately 1500 Taka). For basic ritual/Ziyarah guidance, 5-10 USD (500-1000 Taka) is acceptable.
• Comprehensive Information and Tips: A "total guideline and training" in the app for solo travellers and families, including updated information on Saudi government rules, and practical tips like how to travel from Jeddah to Mecca, where to find cars, how Uber works, and where to buy SIM cards, would be a "game-changer".
• Tailored Services: The app should cater differently to "solo travellers" (who might pay more for support) and "groups" or "families" (who seek flexibility).
Quotes & Memorable Statements – Verbatim; mark [inaudible/best guess].
• "I actually did everything myself."
• "I could choose my preferred time, then choose the hotels where I would stay, and I could design my journey time as I wished. That's why I actually arranged all the transportation myself, keeping comfort in mind, so that I could cater to my comfort at the highest level, meaning, in my own way."
• "When you book there, you can get the best price."
• "It's a bit difficult to take a chance like that with family."
• "Taxis are a bit costly. I think they are very costly for us."
• "It was very expensive comparatively, and it's increasing day by day."
• "Yes, it would definitely add value. This would certainly be very helpful." (Regarding the comprehensive app idea)
• "I actually don't want to use an app as an alternative [for rituals] because sometimes I want to keep away from devices."
• "If it's a one-time payment, then yes." (Regarding pre/post Hajj training)
• "It depends on who is traveling." (Regarding the overall helpfulness of an app)
• "Many people want to go but are afraid, 'Will I find a hotel?', 'How will I pick it?' These guidelines are not updated, and many things change in Saudi government rules and regulations. Because of not knowing these, many people go through agencies, and agencies also keep people in such a way that they feel they must go through them."
Other Observations – Personal reflections, behavioral patterns.
• Hasan Mahmud's primary motivation for self-arranging Umrah was comfort and flexibility. He believes this flexibility is especially important for working professionals who need to manage holidays and family time.
• He is cost-conscious, always looking for the "best price," which sometimes involves physical comparison rather than relying solely on online bookings from home.
• He values transparency in pricing, expressing dissatisfaction with agencies providing only combined costs without breakdowns.
• He has a nuanced view on technology for spiritual practices: while open to apps for logistics and information, he prefers minimal device distraction during core rituals unless a dedicated "focus mode" is available.
• He identifies a common anxiety or "panic" among pilgrims, especially new or individual travellers, regarding basic logistical information upon arrival.
• He believes agencies benefit from pilgrims' lack of updated information about rules and practicalities, which an app could address.
• He expresses a preference for one-time payments for digital services over recurring subscriptions, citing payment hassles from Bangladesh.

# 09. Iftikhar Shirajee

## # Interview Notes:

Shirajee – Mid-Size Hajj Agency Owner
Background Information
• Shirajee is the proprietor of Goziara, a reputed Hajj and Umrah agency in Chittagong, Bangladesh.
• The agency successfully provides services for Hajj and Umrah to the people of Bangladesh.
• While the exact years in business or scale of operations (e.g., number of pilgrims served annually) are not specified, it is mentioned that agencies serving 1000 pilgrims directly are uncommon in Bangladesh.
Journey / Context
• Client Sourcing: The agency's sales primarily occur "only through referrals". This is highlighted as a key characteristic of the Hajj and Umrah industry.
• Bookings & Sourcing:
    ◦ Hotels for Hajj and Umrah are generally sold in "slots" rather than individual bookings.
    ◦ There is a perception among pilgrims that direct booking through platforms like Booking.com or Agoda is cheaper, but Shirajee suggests this is "not 100% true" and often doing it alone can be more expensive.
    ◦ Agencies organise multiple services (tickets, visa, hotel, transport, food) and aim for a "profit of five to six thousand Taka," sometimes up to "ten thousand Taka," though this is "very rare these days in this competitive market".
    ◦ Sourcing hotels directly is challenging due to "pyramid layers" through which hotels change hands, potentially leading to pilgrims paying "almost 50% extra".
    ◦ Saudi entities are reportedly "cutting off agencies" and prefer selling entire hotel allocations (e.g., floors) to larger clients or for multiple years. This high demand leads to hotels being "sold and resold".
• Service Provider Management: The agency deals with various service providers like buses and taxis in Saudi Arabia. Shirajee emphasises the importance of sourcing from reliable companies, even if it means lower profit, to ensure pilgrim safety and secure payments. "Many businesses with Saudis happen through word of mouth," and "a lot of money is paid without any receipt," which is described as risky.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Regulatory Issues & Licensing:
    ◦ The issuance of Hajj licenses by the Bangladesh government has been stopped for many years.
    ◦ This poses a significant challenge as a license is "a must" to operate Hajj or Umrah businesses.
    ◦ It is difficult to acquire an existing license and change its name to match the agency's current business name, like Goziara, as existing licenses are often under different names.
    ◦ The Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh (HAAB) is listing agencies, a good initiative aiming to curb "fraud cases" and "scam pilgrims" by non-compliant agencies.
    ◦ The new Nusuk hotel booking system and general government/Saudi government paperwork present challenges.
• Trust Issues & Scams:
    ◦ Scams and trust issues are a "global problem," not limited to Bangladesh.
    ◦ Pilgrims can be "emotional" and "cannot expect someone to cheat them in this industry".
    ◦ There's a need for pilgrims to be "a bit more educated" on how to check agencies.
    ◦ Building trust is problematic for new or smaller businesses, as sales rely heavily on referrals, leading to "slow" organic growth.
    ◦ Unreliable service providers (buses, taxis) in Saudi Arabia can "scam pilgrims".
    ◦ The risk of advance payments being taken and not returned is a concern, with little recourse for complaint.
• Competition & Pricing:
    ◦ The market is "competitive," making high-profit margins rare.
    ◦ It is difficult for Bangladeshi agencies to directly source hotels at "cheaper rates" compared to global platforms or Hajj-centric agencies like Umrahme due to the layered sourcing chain and lack of direct access to Saudi government's GDS (Global Distribution System).
    ◦ Hotel prices can increase significantly "on the spot" if bookings are not made in advance.
• Customer Behaviour:
    ◦ Pilgrims often exhibit a "childish" behaviour preferring a physical guide and group travel, even for Umrah, despite options for independent travel or technological guidance.
    ◦ They desire "flexible" schedules but still want a human presence for narration during ziyarat.
    ◦ They do not readily embrace technology for guidance, despite information being available through Google.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Business Growth & Sustainability:
    ◦ The agency aims to "grow slowly and steadily" and to "start other wings" to ensure the business reaches break-even.
    ◦ Securing a local (Saudi) license and making "big investments" would significantly ease direct sourcing of services.
• Leveraging Technology for Trust and Efficiency:
    ◦ Online Shop/Marketplace with Verified Reviews: Shirajee believes an online platform built "absolutely on a trust basis," similar to Amazon or Daraz with rating-review systems, could "go a long way" in solving trust issues and referral problems. This would make agencies "accountable".
    ◦ Escrow Service: While direct implementation might be difficult due to the cash-intensive nature of the business, Shirajee agrees that alternatives to ensure pilgrims feel confident they won't be scammed are crucial.
    ◦ Direct Sourcing Platform for Hotels/Services: Shirajee would be "definitely interested" in a third-party tech startup that could directly source from Saudi at "competitive prices" and ensure "safety" through registered contracts. This would solve problems with high costs and unreliable local sourcing.
    ◦ Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System: An "integrated software" for managing customer relationships, tracking pilgrim journeys from lead to sale, maintaining systematic contact, and facilitating referrals would be "very nice" and "very organized" if it is "easy to use". Shirajee would be interested in using it for a small subscription fee, provided data privacy is ensured.
    ◦ WhatsApp Intelligence Software: Shirajee believes using AI to extract intelligence from WhatsApp communications would "add value" by preventing messages from getting lost and allowing important information to be tagged.
• Mobile Guidance: While skeptical about pilgrims fully embracing a mobile-only guide over a human one for flexibility, Shirajee stated that the agency already provides some form of guidance through "banners, small videos". He is open to the idea of offering a mobile guide as an "optional add-on" to packages, especially if it can be promoted effectively.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "To do any business, you need a license, no matter what industry you are in."
• "Rules come into effect when someone breaks the rules."
• "A license is the best authenticity; you will have accountability, your authenticity will be there, people will have accountability."
• "The only sales here happen through referrals."
• "You have to give the best service, the kind of service the guests of Allah deserve."
• "People are emotional, they cannot expect someone to cheat them in this industry."
• "Pilgrims need to be a bit more educated on this [checking agencies]."
• "If your website is built, absolutely on a trust basis, this can go a long way."
• "The Hajj and Umrah business is very cash-intensive."
• "No one will work without profit. If someone works without profit, it has to be a scam."
• "It's better to take service from a professional company. Because a professional company can serve you."
• "It's not 100% true. Always that they get it cheaper by going directly. Rather, doing it alone often costs more."
• "Many businesses with Saudis happen through word of mouth. A lot of money is paid without any receipt. This is a bit risky but again, who are you doing business with?"
• "I will make a little less profit, but I feel safe that my money, meaning the pilgrims' money, will be safe, and the service will be ensured."
• "Hajj, or Hajj, must definitely be done in a group, but even for Umrah, they look for a group."
• "Physical guides actually don't cost much. And in our country, it's going to be difficult because people are very in touch with technology. And in some places, they don't want to use technology."
Other Observations
• The Bangladesh government's decision to stop Hajj license issuance was influenced by numerous cases of fraud and non-compliance by some agencies.
• The Hajj and Umrah sector faces unique challenges compared to other industries, particularly regarding trust and the cash-intensive nature of transactions.
• The demand for Hajj and Umrah services causes prices to increase significantly, unlike typical product discounts for dead stock.
• The "chain" of hotel sourcing in Saudi Arabia, involving multiple resellers, is consistent globally, not just for Bangladesh.
• Pilgrims often prefer a "human guide" for a more personal experience and direct narration during their spiritual journeys, even when informational resources are readily available online. This suggests a strong cultural preference for guided travel.
• WhatsApp is a primary communication tool for pilgrims, but its limitations (lost messages, untagged information) highlight the need for more structured communication solutions.
• Current administrative tasks within agencies are often handled manually, for example, using Excel.

# 10. Imran Naeem

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information – Role and experience as pilgrim, guide, and business owner.
• Imran Naeem is a "sales partner type" for a Dhaka-based agency called Shepherds, whose primary role is to collect pilgrims for Hajj.
• He is described as "recently starting" the Hajj and Umrah business.
• He operates as an individual and markets himself in a personal capacity, rather than through an official institution.
• He currently does not work on Umrah trips.
• His long-term goal, within the next three years, is to establish his own full-fledged agency.
Journey / Context – Nature of Hajj/Umrah trips guided or attended, business size, customer profile.
• Imran's customer leads primarily come from various types of references. His main channels are:
    ◦ A Facebook group where he is an admin.
    ◦ His personal acquaintances who know he works with Hajj.
    ◦ WhatsApp messages.
• He collects clients directly and currently does not have any sub-agents.
• He adopts a "very lean approach" to his work, with primary expenses being his marketing skills and minor incidental costs for promotional activities, rather than actual office maintenance.
• He estimates that acquiring a single customer requires approximately 15 hours of his time, which includes phone calls, meetings, and digital marketing efforts.
• The value from a Hajj client is usually received only once in their lifetime.
• He finds his current tools, Facebook and WhatsApp, to be sufficient for customer management and maintaining agency relations at his present operational level.
• Recent Hajj regulations have introduced challenges, including a reduced registration window of only four months for the upcoming year and a significant payment of 4 lakh Taka required from pilgrims.
Pain Points / Challenges – Training pilgrims, ensuring smooth logistics, managing costs, trust-building, competition.
• Imran identifies several core challenges for his business, especially as he aims to establish his own agency:
    1. Licensing for his own institution, as people would require to know about it.
    2. Adapting to the constantly changing rules and regulations imposed by the Saudi government each year.
    3. Changing mindsets and behaviours of pilgrims over time.
• Trust-building is a significant issue when considering direct sourcing of services from Makkah or Madinah. He notes a lack of trusted contacts there, a gap currently filled by his partner agency, Shepherds.
• He also perceives a lack of organised, service-oriented packages from potential direct Saudi sources for pilgrims' needs.
• Regarding commission, he indicates that the margin is set by the main agency, and the exact percentage varies by package, though he generally considers it fair based on his experience from one year. He noted that his own marketing efforts and time are his main costs.
• The reduced registration window and increased payment requirement for Hajj by the government this year are major factors impacting his strategy.
Opportunities / Suggestions – Ideas for improving training, logistics, spiritual engagement, or agency operations.
• Imran strongly desires to have his own institution where he can purchase services directly from providers rather than acting solely as a sales partner for others.
• He would be interested in purchasing services at B2B rates from validated travel providers in Bangladesh, especially if they guarantee good service with booking reference numbers for hotels.
• A key condition for buying services online or from new providers is the availability of strong reviews from trusted sources or acquaintances who have experienced "100% satisfaction". He would "not prefer buying online unless" these reviews exist.
• He would consider an option where a bare minimum payment is made upfront for trust, with the final payment contingent on the actual hotel stay or service delivery, provided there are sufficient security measures to prevent pilgrims from being stranded. However, he notes that "in those countries, these things cannot always be maintained".
• He is exploring the use of AI tools like ChatGPT for his marketing efforts and operations. He currently uses the free version but plans to upgrade to a paid version specifically for his Hajj and Umrah business.
• He would consider a dedicated AI service, specifically trained on the Hajj and Umrah market, that provides guidance on Saudi analyses, services, and market strategy, only if it offers "tangible extra benefits or solutions that ChatGPT cannot provide". He values efficiency and will use it if he "benefited".
Quotes & Memorable Statements – Verbatim phrases; mark [inaudible/best guess] when unclear.
• Imran: "I actually have various types of references, especially from a group where I am an admin; leads come from there. They come from people in my personal acquaintance. They come from various kinds of people."
• Imran: "No, no, we don't really have an official institution in that sense, where someone would come directly to me. I primarily work as an individual, and I market myself as an individual. People come to me directly. So the main thing here is that your channel is, first of all, referrals, and second is your Facebook group or, say, WhatsApp messages, mainly referrals."
• Imran: "I primarily work with Shepherds in Dhaka. I work with Shepherds. Basically, they maintain everything, and we just collect the pilgrims, meaning I'm a sales partner type."
• Imran: "My expenses are essentially my marketing skills, and minor incidental expenses if I do any boosting or promotional activities. But actual office maintenance or other costs that I would calculate, we don't have those kinds of expenses."
• Imran: "No, we definitely want our own institution, where I will buy the service directly, as an individual institution, not from someone else."
• Imran: "The main thing here is actually there is [inaudible]. From this, one service is that, and another is that they don't provide various service-oriented packages, or pilgrims are fewer."
• Imran: "I would not prefer buying online unless they have... what do you call it? A lot of reviews, like someone I know has taken the service and received 100% satisfaction. Only then would I be interested."
• Imran: "This actually depends on the situation. In those countries, these things cannot always be maintained."
• Imran: "First, licensing. Since a license is an essential matter now, if I work as an institution, people will want to know about my license. We must keep this in mind. Besides this, the second thing is that rules and regulations are changing every year; the Saudi government is changing rules. So, what the Saudi government does next year will determine what happens afterwards. The third is that the pilgrims' mindsets are actually changing every year; what will happen next year is another factor."
• Imran: "If I don't benefit, I won't use it. If I benefit, then of course I will try to use it."
• Imran: "You will only subscribe to an AI model when you feel it does something extra beyond ChatGPT, because you are getting many things [from ChatGPT]."
Other Observations – Attitude toward tech adoption, customer needs, recurring themes.
• High Value on Trust and Reviews: A recurring theme is Imran's strong emphasis on personal trust and reliable reviews from known individuals, especially when considering new service providers or direct sourcing. This is prioritised over large platform names or general online offerings.
• Lean Operational Mindset: His current business model is very cost-effective, with minimal overheads and a focus on leveraging personal networks and digital marketing.
• Pragmatic Approach to AI: While open to and already using AI (ChatGPT), Imran has a practical and benefit-driven attitude towards adopting new technology. He will only invest in a specialised AI tool if it offers clear, demonstrable advantages that current general-purpose AI tools cannot provide for his specific business needs.
• Time-Intensive Customer Acquisition: The significant time commitment (15 hours per customer) underscores the personal and trust-based nature of his current client acquisition process.
• Impact of External Regulations: He frequently highlights how external factors, such as changing Saudi government rules and reduced registration windows, directly affect his operational strategy and planning.

# 11. Jamael Tanvir

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Age and Residency: Jamael Tanvir is in the age group of 35 to 40 and currently resides in Germany.
• Trip Types and Years: He performed Umrah in 2020, Hajj in 2022, and Umrah in 2023. He also went for Umrah last year (in addition to the 2023 trip mentioned).
• Travel Arrangements:
    ◦ His recent Umrah trip was performed by himself, not through an agency.
    ◦ His Hajj trip was organised through an agency that provided day-long training sessions on multiple occasions.
• Visa: He has a Bangladeshi passport but a residence permit in Germany, which helped him get a visa easily. He applied for a one-year, multiple-entry travel visa, marking that he intended to perform Umrah.
Journey / Context
• Booking Process:
    ◦ He booked his hotel through Check24.de, which is very popular in Germany and has partnerships with Booking.com and Agoda.com, making it intuitive for users.
    ◦ Visa processing was also done personally by applying through the official visa portal.
• Accommodation: He booked a three-star hotel that was pretty close to Kaaba and within walking distance. He found the service quality to be good, and the staff were very helpful and respectful.
• Commute from Jeddah Airport:
    ◦ He landed in Jeddah airport, which was a stopover before he travelled to Bangladesh, meaning he had a lot of luggage.
    ◦ The commute to the hotel was generally fine, but finding transport was a challenge.
    ◦ He opted for a private car, as taxis were very expensive, even though private cars operate in a grey area of legality in Saudi Arabia. He haggled the price based on prior research from others who used similar services.
    ◦ He did not take the train due to the large amount of luggage he had, as he would still need to find further transportation from the Makkah station to his hotel. He preferred the directness of a car for carrying luggage.
• Activities in Makkah: His activities included performing Umrah (Tawaf and Sai), as well as general sightseeing, shopping, and eating.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Hotel Cost: He faced an issue with hotel prices; it was difficult to find a hotel close to Kaaba within his budget because prices were quite high, especially as he travelled in early December, which is a busy month.
• Airport Transportation: Finding affordable transport from Jeddah airport was a challenge, as official taxis were very expensive, and he had to resort to semi-legal private cars.
• First-time Visitor Orientation: For someone going to Makkah for the first time, navigating the area around Kaaba (finding hotels, routes to Haram, restaurants, and shopping) is "very difficult and it's kind of a puzzle".
• Ritual Guidance and Panic: Despite agency training for Hajj, he felt a "panic situation, a panic mode" about performing rituals correctly, especially wearing Ihram for the first time. He found online tutorials varied, which further confused him.
• Keeping Track of Rituals: It is "very easy to forget how many laps" one has completed during Tawaf.
• App-Related Distractions and Risks:
    ◦ Apps can create "lots of distraction" due to random notifications.
    ◦ In very crowded situations, following an app is difficult, and there's a risk of the phone breaking or being lost.
    ◦ Automated Tawaf lap tracking via GPS might be "too risky to introduce" due to "the slightest error" in a small area potentially causing false positives.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Comprehensive Hajj/Umrah App: He believes an app that acts as a "go-to companion" would be highly beneficial, providing all necessary information in one place without needing to search elsewhere (e.g., YouTube).
• Enhanced Navigation and Information:
    ◦ An app would "help a lot" for first-time visitors to find popular markets and good places to eat in Jeddah and Makkah.
    ◦ Filtering options for cuisine (e.g., Bangladeshi food) are crucial, especially for those who prefer specific types of food.
    ◦ Information on where to buy items like fresh dates at fair prices would be valuable, as shops near Haram are expensive and may not offer fresh produce.
• Sightseeing and Historical Tours:
    ◦ The app should include an itinerary or exploration plan for historical places in Makkah (including Taif and mountains) and Madina.
    ◦ This should feature audio/video overviews explaining why certain places are famous, enabling self-guided tours.
    ◦ He suggests the app could also connect users with travel agencies within Saudi Arabia that can offer authentic tours based on Islamic history.
• Online Training and Preparation:
    ◦ "It's very important" to have a comprehensive online training course for Hajj and Umrah, offered three months prior to the trip.
    ◦ This course should be on-demand with audio-visual content and a modular schedule for self-learning, preparing pilgrims logistically and spiritually.
    ◦ It would help first-timers and allow repeat pilgrims to "brush up" their memory.
• Multi-School of Thought Content: The app should provide rulings from different Islamic schools of thought (e.g., Hanafi) to offer flexibility, ensuring content is backed by Quran and Sunnah.
• Checklist-Style App: A checklist-style app with all steps and action items, like an Umrah guide, would be "definitely, definitely helpful".
• Tawaf Lap Counter: A counter within the app would "definitely, definitely help" pilgrims to concentrate on making duas without worrying about the count.
• Smartwatch Integration: To mitigate distractions and phone risks, integrating a watch app with the main app would allow pilgrims to follow everything from their watch, keeping their phone secure. It could track laps and remind users of duas.
• Dua Module:
    ◦ The app should include a listing of popular duas (e.g., from Hisnul Muslim).
    ◦ Users should be able to favourite duas that are relevant to their life for easy access.
• Spiritual Transformation and Reflection:
    ◦ Preparation (through workshops, meetings, or app content) is crucial for pilgrims to understand the benefits and significance of the actions they are performing. This understanding automatically helps them reflect and ponder.
    ◦ The app could contain video content from renowned scholars on these spiritual topics.
    ◦ He suggests incorporating a journaling feature within the app for pilgrims to write down thoughts and ideas during their high spiritual state.
    ◦ Using AI/LLM to create a post-Umrah plan or pledges (e.g., praying regularly, reading Quran, being a better person) based on journaling would be beneficial. The app could then remind users to follow these pledges.
• Monetary Model: He suggests a one-time purchase model is more suitable than a subscription-based model because Umrah/Hajj is not performed every month or year. For an app that provides everything discussed, he suggests a price between $20 to $30 for a one-time purchase. If a yearly subscription were the only option, he estimates around $10.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "I mean, I'm in the age group of 35 to 40, I would say, and I'm currently residing in Germany. Yes."
• "So if you search for some hotel, if that is not listed in Check24, then they can also search those uh, listings from Booking.com or similar similar uh, websites and list them into Check24. So it's very uh, you know, intuitive for users. So that's why it's very popular in Germany and that's what I used actually."
• "So if, I mean, I wanted to uh, find a hotel close to Kaaba uh, and when I searched for it, I found that the uh, price is a bit high on the high side. So, it was a bit difficult to find a hotel within my budget."
• "It's a puzzle, in my opinion, this area around Kaaba. It's very difficult to find hotels, find routes to go to Haram, and find restaurants to eat, and also shopping, etc. It's actually very difficult and it's kind of a puzzle if someone is going there for the first time."
• "Especially there are many Bangladeshis who cannot actually eat anything other than Bangladeshi food. So, uh, it's important for him to find some Bangladeshi restaurants around the Haram area, and not all of them are, you know, uh, very visible from the public space."
• "But when it was about time to leave for Makkah, uh, I was still uh, in kind of a panic situation, a panic uh, mode that uh, am I, am I going to do it properly or am I going to make mistakes?"
• "So if, if an app that can give me uh, a comprehensive uh, training course, that will help me in a sense that I don't have to look for it in different places."
• "So if I have a counter, that would definitely, definitely help um, not to uh, not to be bothered about the count. So and I can uh, I can actually concentrate on making duas, so that will definitely help."
• "So if the app can provide all these contents that helps the user to understand that you are going to perform these things and what what are the, you know, benefits, what are the significance of this, what are the significance of these things, uh, uh, then the user will be able to understand that, yes, I'm going to do these actions, I, I'm going to perform Umrah, I'm going to uh, go for Hajj and perform these actions. Then he will feel within himself that, yes, now I'm doing something that is a very, very important part of my life that automatically helps the Hajis to reflect upon it."
• "So um, yeah, I mean, I was thinking uh, there, there could be two options. One is uh, this uh, one-time purchase, and another one is a subscription-based model. Um, maybe, maybe in this case, uh, one-time purchase is uh, more suitable because uh, we do not perform Umrah every month or every year, maybe uh, or every two, three months, usually it's not the case. So subscription-based model may not be suitable."
• "So if I, instead of offering one-time payment, if it's uh, give you like a yearly subscription, so you pay for and the content will remain there for a year, so in that case, uh, how much do you think might be good? Um, okay, in case of this kind of subscription model, um, uh, I would think um, I would say $10."
Other Observations
• Jamael Tanvir is very articulate and provides detailed, insightful feedback, often drawing on his personal experiences to illustrate points.
• He is open to new technologies, suggesting leveraging AI and LLMs for journaling and post-Umrah planning.
• He shows willingness to be a future beta tester and provide more detailed insights on pricing.
• He acknowledges the diversity in religious practices by suggesting that an app should cater to different Islamic schools of thought.

# 12. Kayes Ansari

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
Name: Kaiyes Ansari

Age Group: 30–40

Pilgrimage Type: Umrah (4 times total)

Trip Types: 2 with an agency, 2 DIY

Travel Timing: Has traveled during Ramadan

Interviewer: Muhammad

Journey / Context
DIY Travel Preference:

Strong preference for DIY trips due to lower cost (about two-thirds of agency cost), greater flexibility, and avoidance of layered middlemen.

Used Booking.com for hotel bookings and found it far better than agency options.

No issues with visa arrangements.

Agency Experience:

Used a mid-sized Bangladeshi agency for two trips.

Felt services were overpriced, with multiple intermediaries before service delivery.

Ziyarat schedule was rigid and didn’t match his interests, so he skipped it entirely.

Lacked trust in agency’s guidance quality.

Local Transport & Logistics:

Madinah → Jeddah taxi required extensive haggling, with uncertainty over fair pricing.

General taxi experience was negative due to risk of scams.

Local Service Discovery:

Around the Haram, he felt lost on where to eat or shop.

No easy way to find trustworthy, good-value options.

Ritual Guidance:

Relied on a physical book and a free offline dua/ritual app.

Found this combination sufficient — no need for media-rich or always-online tools.

Pain Points / Challenges
Taxi pricing and trust issues caused stress and uncertainty.

Agency “pyramid” model felt exploitative.

Rigid Ziyarat schedule limited spiritual customization.

Poor discovery of local services led to missed good food and shopping.

No trusted all-in-one booking tool for Hajj & Umrah.

Opportunities / Suggestions
Hajj & Umrah Marketplace Platform:

Booking.com-style service with transparent pricing, verified providers, and standardized quality.

Improved Local Service Discovery:

Tools to find trustworthy restaurants, shops, and services near Haram.

Transport Coordination Features:

Pre-booked or vetted taxi services to avoid scams.

Offline-First Ritual Guide:

Maintain book + offline app model for accessibility.

Partnership Potential:

Open to collaborating with Saudi-licensed Bangladeshi operators.

Quotes & Memorable Statements
“DIY is about two-thirds the cost of an agency trip.”

“The agency system is a pyramid of middlemen.”

“I skipped Ziyarat entirely because the schedule didn’t suit me.”

“Around Haram, I didn’t know where to eat or shop — no easy way to find out.”

Other Observations
Kaiyes is experienced, values independence, and seeks transparency.

Cost-conscious but prioritizes control and clarity.

Sees agencies as more useful for first-timers; experienced pilgrims benefit from self-managed travel with trusted tools.

# 13. Mahmud Iqbal

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Trip Type(s): Mahmud Iqbal Halim performed Hajj and Umrah.
• Year(s): He completed Hajj in 2025, which corresponds to 1446 Hijri.
• Preparation Approach:
    ◦ He primarily prepared through online classes and recorded videos provided by his agency. He found this to be "a great help to prepare myself, not only logistically, but also...from a spiritual perspective".
    ◦ He supplemented this by asking other individuals who had prior experience with the same agency or Hajj, and by watching specific lecture sessions or videos on YouTube.
    ◦ The agency's sessions were conducted by their guides and scholars to help shape the training for the journey.
Journey / Context
• Planning Tools:
    ◦ Agency-provided lecture sessions and webinars.
    ◦ YouTube for specific topics and questions.
    ◦ Google Translate was a "lifesaver" for communication.
    ◦ Used Apple (devices) for location sharing.
    ◦ Downloaded a manual offline map.
    ◦ Used AirTags for tracking family members (wife and mother), which "helped us a lot" especially when they got lost during farewell Tawaf.
• Agency/DIY Details:
    ◦ He travelled with Shepard Umrah Service, describing them as "pretty professional and very cooperative". They offered sessions prior to registration.
    ◦ For future Umrah, he feels "more informed now to perform my Umrah" independently, noting it would make his journey "straightforward, everything under my control". However, he acknowledges that agencies can help maintain spiritual connection beyond just the rituals.
• Key Milestones / Decisions:
    ◦ Choice of Departure Country: Despite living in Canada with dual Canadian and Bangladeshi nationality, he chose to perform Hajj from Bangladesh. His primary considerations were the custody of his young children (aged five and three and a half) while he and his wife were away, and budget, as Hajj from Canada was "pretty expensive".
    ◦ SIM Card Strategy: Initially, he used a Bangladesh SIM with roaming capability for about a week. After that, he purchased a Saudi SIM package. He found this was a "good decision in terms of communication" because a local SIM "will give you an edge in terms of communication" in crowded areas like Mina or Arafat, and "gives you a lot less headache when you are lost" and need to use a map. He initially relied on roaming because it took him two days to figure out where to buy a Saudi SIM card after settling into the hotel.
    ◦ Navigating Makkah: He found the "mental preparation was the key" to dealing with the logistical challenges, such as "super strict security-wise" checks and "ever-changing" rules, which he was ready for.
    ◦ Sightseeing: He did not visit Ta'if due to a short trip and concerns about road closures. He only managed to visit the Hira Cave (Jabal [best guess: al-Nour]) but avoided a quick tour arranged by the agency due to a conflicting schedule on the day before moving to Medina.
    ◦ Shopping: He was advised by guides to do shopping in Medina rather than Mecca, as it is "cheaper," offers "variety," and provides "a lot of bargaining power".
Pain Points / Challenges
• Custody and Budget: The primary challenges in the planning phase were arranging care for his small children and the high cost of Hajj from Canada.
• Online Training Limitations: Due to a 10-11 hour time difference, he couldn't join live online sessions, leading to the need to ask others or search YouTube for answers to specific questions. He felt in-person attendance might have provided a better understanding or facilitated team building.
• Hesitancy in Seeking Guidance: He observed that pilgrims were often "hesitant to ask questions to the fellow Hajji or even the scholar in that group or even the agency people," who were sometimes unavailable.
• Unclear Religious Guidance:
    ◦ He experienced confusion on minor details of rituals, such as "when to wear the Ihram" or "when to make the Nia".
    ◦ He had to carry "too many notebooks with dua list," distinguishing between recommended and mandatory prayers, which an app could simplify.
• Logistical Issues in Makkah:
    ◦ The overall experience in Makkah was "super strict security-wise," with "a lot of checks and restrictions" and "ever-changing" rules from Saudi authorities.
    ◦ The after-procedures upon boarding in Jeddah were "really tiring".
    ◦ Road closures were a significant challenge, making taxi services difficult to find, expensive, or causing long detours, leading to "too much crowd" and "a lot of issues". He recalled a taxi leaving them "almost 2 km away" from Haram Sharif for Juma prayer due to road closures.
    ◦ He had difficulty finding his wife after prayers when the group scattered.
    ◦ Commuting was time-consuming, sometimes taking "more than two or three hours for commuting, just for a 20-minute drive" due to unfamiliarity with the area and road closures. Even guides can get lost due to random road closures.
• Communication Barrier: He cited the language barrier with drivers as a reason for being "scammed" or overpaying for rides.
• Shopping Challenges in Medina:
    ◦ He found it challenging to buy quality dates and other items due to being "busy with staying more in the Masjid an-Nabawi".
    ◦ He lacked information on "which item to buy from which market," or where to find wholesale markets.
    ◦ Shopping time was limited due to intense daytime heat, forcing shopping primarily after Isha prayer or between Maghrib and Asr.
    ◦ He was confused by the prevalence of "Chinese products" and difficulty in discerning quality for items like prayer mats.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Interactive Hajj/Umrah App:
    ◦ Comprehensive Ritual Guidance: An app should "keep you in line" by providing step-by-step guidance on rituals, duas (prayers), and what's allowed or not allowed, similar to how Duolingo offers quizzes. It should cover common scenarios.
    ◦ Preparation Materials: Include detailed "preparation materials, I mean, item-wise or action-wise".
    ◦ Mock Tests: The ability to "do like a mock test in an interactive app" would be highly beneficial.
    ◦ Quiz-Based Learning: A "quiz-based learning" approach, similar to Duolingo, with scenarios (e.g., "which dua you would like to make") and small puzzles (e.g., arranging Mina, Arafat in order) would be a "great idea" and an interactive way to learn.
    ◦ Interactive Maps and Logistics:
        ▪ An app could provide an "interactive map" showing crowd movement (similar to Google Maps traffic) to give pilgrims an idea of "where the roads, how people are moving, how things are happening".
        ▪ It should offer information on road closures and alternative transportation solutions, such as bus services, particularly for those staying far from Haram.
        ▪ The app should guide pilgrims on specific Haram gates, nearest bus stops, or taxi stands, ideally with pictures and routes.
        ▪ It should provide "informative" tips like using bus service for those living far from Haram as it "saves a lot of hassle finding a taxi and whatsoever".
    ◦ Crowd-Sourced Information: Implement features allowing pilgrims to "make comments" or share real-time information (e.g., road closures) like Twitter or Waze, even if they don't share their location.
    ◦ Location Sharing: While beneficial, he suggests it "should be more easier" and potentially optional, with crowd-sourced comments as an alternative for those hesitant to share live location.
    ◦ Post-Hajj Features: An app could offer features for "after Hajj experience or after Hajj follow-up" to help pilgrims "ponder upon the learning," interact with others, and "keep myself focused, what I learned from Hajj and how I'm acting upon it".
    ◦ Spiritual Themes/Lessons: For future Umrah, the app could integrate "spiritual guidance" and allow users to "choose a theme," offering lessons and guiding them to specific areas or activities for deeper focus (e.g., Tafsir for Ramadan Umrah).
• Shopping and Food Guidance:
    ◦ The app should include information on "most popular spot[s]" for shopping, item-wise recommendations (e.g., quality prayer mats, dates, gold), price ranges, and quality insights.
    ◦ Suggestions for exploring local cuisine and "good things to try" for food.
• AI for Communication: An AI that converses fluently in Arabic with locals (e.g., taxi drivers) on behalf of the user, showing live captions of the conversation, would be a "great idea" that "looks nice and that looks good".
• "Super App" Concept: He suggests having "one simple app" with "different sections" that are "super-duper equipped" for rituals, logistics, after-Hajj programs, hotel/air ticket booking, shopping, and sightseeing. The app should be "in-depth but it's straightforward, concise," and "not too much detail", allowing users to "deep dive" if they want, but ensuring "the basic information should be covered".
• Pricing Strategy:
    ◦ He would prefer everything to be free if it's general information.
    ◦ He considers $15 for a trip "too much".
    ◦ He believes people will pay if the app offers "real value," such as arrangements with agencies for tours or discounts, similar to how Uber offers work.
    ◦ He states he would "have no issues spending minimum $5 to $10" if the app is "super interactive and easy to use" and includes all the discussed features. He also suggests regional pricing might be necessary.
    ◦ He emphasizes that "if the logistics are taken care of, I can focus more on the Ibadah".
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "Budget and custody of my children when I'll be performing the Hajj was my consideration to going from Bangladesh."
• "Yeah, of course. I would say that was a great help to prepare myself, not only logistically, but also, as you said, from a spiritual perspective."
• "But I felt like if I wasn't present in person, maybe I could have a better understanding or even, I mean, that could have been better in some ways, like, you know, team building."
• "Having an app definitely would keep you in line, right? Like which ritual comes after what and what you need to do, especially making duas and doing the rituals."
• "I think this is a great idea because, yeah, I mean, often I saw people, they were hesitant to ask questions to the fellow Hajji or even the scholar in that group or even the agency people. Sometimes they were not available."
• "I was asking people what to do. And also, I was, you know, carrying too many notebooks with dua list, and some are recommended and some are mandatory, right? So an app like this, because we all carry phones, right, should make things easy."
• "The preparation, the mental preparation was the key, you know. Sometimes you have nothing to do, you have to follow the rules, and the rules are ever-changing. That's the mindset I went with, and that helped me a lot."
• "If you have the local SIM, that will give you an edge in terms of communication. And trust me, it gives you a lot less headache when you are lost in the Haram Sharif or any place in Arafat or Mina, to use a map."
• "Location sharing was the key when you were moving with your agency or the guides, right?"
• "Logistically, I found it challenging because a lot of roads were closed, right?"
• "For people who are living far away from the Haram during this Hajj or after Hajj, I think it is better for them to use the bus service because it goes as much as close to the Haram Sharif, saves a lot of hassle finding a taxi and whatsoever."
• "Even people are not contributing, they can make comments, stuff like that."
• "We shared AirTags in between us so that each of us can track and follow where our locations are. So that actually helped during our last days when we were doing the farewell Tawaf, we actually lost each other, and the AirTag helped us a lot because I was calling them, they said we are in this side, I was not finding them because the location was not precise in Google. And even the AirTag, it's more approximate, and it helped a lot to track where each of us were. So it helped us a lot, the AirTagging."
• "It's better to do shopping in Medina. In Medina, like that, yeah, it's cheaper. You have variety, and you have a lot of bargaining power."
• "If I were you, I would put everything for free."
• "$15 is too much."
• "If you want to make some money out of it, it's better to give them some real value."
• "I think if I find it, whatever we discussed here, if everything is there, and it's super interactive and easy to use, I have no issues spending minimum $5 to $10."
• "It's more challenging to keep the spirit up, being connected spiritually from the beginning to end, and the end is not the end, the end is just another beginning."
• "What I think, you can have one simple app, but you can have different sections, and those sections could, in itself, be super-duper equipped, right?"
• "I don't mind if it's a super equipped app, but it has to be navigated, it should be designed such a way it's in-depth but it's straightforward, concise. It's not too much detail."
• "The basic information should be covered. That's the thing. I don't mind having logistics information upfront for me. Because for me, if the logistics are taken care of, I can focus more on the Ibadah."
Other Observations
• Attitude towards Religious Learning: Mahmud Iqbal Halim emphasizes the importance of spiritual preparation and staying connected spiritually throughout and after the Hajj, viewing the end of Hajj not as a conclusion but as "just another beginning" for continuous spiritual growth and sincerity. He desires tools that can help him "keep the spirit up" and "revive your spirituality".
• Service Expectations: He values information that saves time, believing that time saved can be better utilized for acts of worship (Ibadah). He also notes that people will pay for services that offer "real value" and tangible benefits like saving time and money.
• User Experience for Apps: He stresses that an app, even if "super equipped," must be "straightforward, concise" and easy to navigate to prevent users from getting "lost if it's super extensive". He acknowledges that many senior pilgrims may struggle with maps and technology.
• Patience and Adaptability: His experience taught him that "the preparation, the mental preparation was the key" to dealing with the constantly "ever-changing" rules and unexpected challenges.

    ◦ Future Umrah Plans: Kibria plans to do Umrah by himself with his family (including his kids, if Allah allows). He feels comfortable arranging it independently now that he knows the rituals and finds it easy to get a visa with his Canadian passport.
    ◦ Hajj Requirement: He believes Hajj definitely requires traveling with a group.
Journey / Context
• Travel Experience:
    ◦ His first Umrah was "quite busy" due to it being just after COVID, which resulted in a very large crowd. It was also during Ramadan, making it even more crowded.
    ◦ The initial Umrah experience was "really helpful" for preparing for Hajj, as he became familiar with the area and found it easy to navigate.
    ◦ For Hajj, being with a group helped him know where to go and he was "a bit mentally prepared" for the rituals and their durations.
    ◦ Travel between Makkah and Madina was done by bullet train, which was a "very good experience" taking only two hours.
• Accommodations:
    ◦ During his first Umrah, he stayed a bit far from the Haram, approximately 25-30 minutes away.
    ◦ He booked his hotel through Booking.com.
• Service Providers:
    ◦ The hotel management was "definitely not as cooperative" as expected regarding the promised shuttle bus service during his first Umrah.
    ◦ For Ziyarah (visiting various places), they took a taxi with a Bangladeshi driver. They visited common places in Madina but not much in Makkah.
    ◦ The Hajj pilgrimage was with a group from Dhaka, comprising more than 200 people.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Overcrowding: The first Umrah, post-COVID and during Ramadan, was extremely crowded as many people who couldn't travel earlier were now able to perform the pilgrimage.
• Poor Facilities/Logistics:
    ◦ Hotel Shuttle Service: The hotel advertised a shuttle bus, but it was "not well organized" and "not that frequently" available, sometimes leaving him to take a taxi.
    ◦ Distance from Haram: Staying far from the Haram made it "very difficult to perform five prayers" at the mosque.
    ◦ Physical Preparation for Rituals: He was not prepared for the physical demands of Tawaf, especially on the second floor, which he later realised was almost 7 km long. His wife was "literally put on walk" due to exhaustion. He emphasised the importance of "mental preparation and physical preparation".
    ◦ Transportation (Taxis):
        ▪ Lack of Standardized Fares: From Jeddah to Makkah, there's "no kind of a standard practice" for taxi fares, leaving foreigners unsure of the "fair rate".
        ▪ Bargaining Culture: Within Makkah and Madina, taxi drivers often demand "two, three times more than what is the actual fare," necessitating constant bargaining.
        ▪ Unused Meters: Drivers have meters but are "not seen anyone following the meter".
        ▪ Communication Gap: A "big problem" was that many taxi drivers "don't speak English," while he doesn't speak Arabic.
    ◦ Local Bus Payment Issues: He faced trouble paying for Makkah bus tickets because his credit card's PIN verification was tied to his Canadian phone number (which he wasn't using with his Bangladesh SIM). He eventually managed to pay using Apple Pay.
• Lack of Guidance/Information:
    ◦ During his first Umrah, he felt "quite overwhelmed" by the "big area" and was "not sure where I am right now".
    ◦ He lacked knowledge about the duration of rituals, such as Safa and Marwa taking "one or two hours at least".
    ◦ He struggled to buy Makkah bus tickets due to the bus driver speaking Arabic and not knowing where to purchase them.
    ◦ Many people, including himself, are unaware of the context or stories behind certain rituals, such as "why they are throwing stone" at Jamarat.
    ◦ Hajj Training Sessions: The 12-13 online training sessions provided by the Hajj group were "very informative" but "too long" and "day long," often starting at night and finishing in the morning, making it difficult for him to attend. Online participants found it hard to follow due to discussions among in-person attendees and prayer breaks.
    ◦ Trust in New Booking Platforms: Kibria noted that it "will take some time for sure to to build that trust and customer feedback" for any new portal compared to established ones like Booking.com, where he knows they are "reliable".
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Technology Use (Particularly AI and Machine Learning):
    ◦ Hotel Booking Portal: A new Hajj and Umrah booking portal could gain trust if it's "managed by certain group that I know of," especially if they are "well reputed...in the Muslim community." Customer feedback, price options, and accessibility are also crucial.
    ◦ Integrated Transportation App:
        ▪ An app that allows users to call a taxi with a "fixed rate" to eliminate bargaining, similar to Uber (which he heard doesn't work during Hajj).
        ▪ An app that can "reconcile all this transportation in one place" for buying local bus tickets, taxis, and even train tickets.
        ▪ Even if direct booking is not possible due to regulations, the app could provide essential information like price ranges, which local bus to take, and where to buy tickets, acting as a guide.
        ▪ An app to book local taxi drivers for inter-city travel (e.g., Makkah to Madina) to avoid having to "wait in on the street" to find drivers.
    ◦ Ritual Guidance App:
        ▪ Consolidated Duas: An app should contain all duas "mentioned in Quran and in Hadith," ideally categorized by need (e.g., for Shifa), similar to how the Nusuk app organizes them. This provides "peace of mind" that nothing is missed.
        ▪ AI Chatbot for Duas/Guidance: While a categorized list is preferable for duas, an AI chatbot could be helpful for specific questions, providing "authentic answers" based on verified information.
        ▪ Structured Ritual Information: The app could consolidate the "five days of rituals" (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) with associated activities. It could also provide context or stories behind rituals (e.g., "what happened here and why we do that" for throwing stones at Jamarat) to add value and understanding.
        ▪ Concise Hajj Training: The app could offer "short clips" or "key takeaway points" from the extensive Hajj training sessions, providing essential information without needing to watch long videos, with links for those who want to learn more.
    ◦ Post-Hajj App Features: After Hajj, an app could provide daily reminders or tips to help maintain the "spirit of Hajj," such as prompts for five daily prayers in the mosque, treating people nicely, and avoiding common sins like backbiting and useless talks.
    ◦ Comprehensive AI Online Travel Guide/Companion: Kibria believes an app that combines hotel booking, all the mentioned features, and acts like a "travel companion" providing guidance at every step would "add value" and he would be "willing to pay for such a solution". He suggested a price point of $5 to $10 USD per month, or a one-time fee of around $15 with a lower monthly fee (e.g., $2) for post-Hajj reminders, noting that users might pay more during Hajj time.
• Better Accommodation Options: He strongly suggested staying closer to the Haram to avoid difficulties with daily prayers. If staying far, the hotel's shuttle bus service needs to be "well organized" and frequent.
• Improved Crowd Management: While not directly offering solutions, the experience highlighted the need for better management strategies, especially during peak seasons like Ramadan post-COVID.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "I was quite overwhelmed with that area it was so so I mean big area and I was not sure where I am I am right now".
• "if next time if I go definitely I will not stay far from the haram because it it becomes very difficult to perform five players".
• "The preparation mental preparation and physical preparation I think those are very important".
• "I was really having trouble to pay um to buy ticket for Matabas. But luckily I was able to pay with Apple app uh Apple Apple uh yeah Apple tap or Apple Pay sorry Apple Pay".
• "if there is a app that can kind of reconcile all this transportation in one place".
• "I found that book that we got from shepherd handy where there they have lot of or most of the duas um that are mentioned in Quran and in hadith right so literally because I don't remember all of these duas".
• "Same thing in in Arafa because people run out of duas, right? So those people will find it very handy when they have all the duas mentioned in Quran and also in hadith.".
• Regarding his post-Hajj spiritual change: "I think the balance has gone towards more towards practicing and inclining towards the then where what I used to do before".
• On contemplating moving from Canada: "I'm honestly thinking and putting my thoughts on whether I should really stay in in this country or I should go back" because "this is not not the right environment uh to grow kids to to raise kids here because of so many factors".
• "after Hajj maybe Allah has given me something in my mind that has changed my the way of thinking".
• On the proposed app: "I think what you are doing is is definitely could be quite impactful for the um, uh, and uh, I can see that that you have the right intention to really help people. So, uh, with that, it can be quite valuable. It can come very handy for a lot of people who are going there for the first time, who doesn't know um, what to do and where to start.".
Other Observations
• Service Delivery Patterns:
    ◦ Online reviews for hotels (e.g., on Booking.com) are often "not very helpful" due to varying customer experiences.
    ◦ Group travel for Hajj proved to be beneficial for organisation and mental preparation, contrasting with the self-arranged Umrah experience.
• Emotional Responses:
    ◦ Kibria felt "overwhelmed" by the sheer size and crowd of the area during his first Umrah.
    ◦ He recognised a significant spiritual shift after Hajj, leading to a greater prioritisation of his Deen (religious practice) over worldly life. This includes making conscious efforts to pray on time and in the mosque, despite typical excuses.
    ◦ The spiritual impact of Hajj led him to seriously consider whether remaining in a Western country is the best environment for raising his children, noting a "vast difference" in manners between children growing up in Bangladesh (e.g., in Madrasah) and those in Canada. This thought process was new to him post-Hajj.
    ◦ He expressed enthusiasm for the proposed technology solution, believing it would be "quite valuable" and "handy" for pilgrims, especially first-timers.

# 15. Md Shahjad Hussain Jishan

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information – Pilgrimage type(s), year(s), trip format.
• Jishan first performed Umrah in December 2017, returning in the first week of January 2018.
• He performed Hajj in 2022.
• His first Umrah was through a small agency that mainly booked air tickets and hotels, with the rest coordinated by Jishan and his wife on arrival. They did not have an individual guide but went under a 'mualim' system prevalent then.
• For Hajj, Jishan registered in 2018 for 2020 with Shepherd's Hajj. The Hajj was delayed to 2022 due to COVID-19.
Journey / Context – Travel planning, service providers, companions.
• Umrah (2017/2018):
    ◦ Travel planning was minimal, with Jishan admitting he "didn't go knowing much about Hajj or Umrah at that time" and "couldn't study enough" due to work commitments, even flying directly from a work conference in Thailand to Umrah.
    ◦ He relied on his friend and the small agency for guidance, which primarily handled flight and hotel bookings.
    ◦ He was accompanied by his wife and a friend.
• Hajj (2022):
    ◦ After his Umrah experience, Jishan and his wife proactively sought an agency that would provide "learning" and "impart knowledge" for Hajj, not just typical management.
    ◦ They chose Shepherd's Hajj because its Shariah consultant, Dr. Manjur Elahi, was known to provide proper education and ensure the Hajj was performed correctly.
    ◦ They attended over 20 Hajj classes with Shepherd's Hajj, including online sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly prepared him.
    ◦ Jishan made a conscious effort to pay for Hajj with earnings from a halal job, having left a previous job in 2021 due to concerns about the product being non-halal.
    ◦ He considered himself "part of this Hajj caravan" as a volunteer, guide, and participant.
    ◦ During Hajj, Jishan was accompanied by his wife, and was continuously supported by their Sheikh and two brothers from the Hajj agency.
Pain Points / Challenges – Service deficiencies, logistical barriers, cost issues.
• Lack of preparation and guidance for Umrah: Jishan felt he "didn't go knowing much" and didn't understand which supplications (duas) to recite where, or the significance of certain places. He felt he "couldn't really grasp" the 'sahih tarika' (correct method).
• Logistical difficulties and movement:
    ◦ Challenges arose in terms of accommodation location, with pilgrims asking whether to go to Madinah or Makkah first, and where to stay in Makkah.
    ◦ A major challenge was minimizing movement between hotels during Hajj.
    ◦ Getting lost after Arafat, when a bus dropped them far from their Mina camp, leading to a long and tiring walk.
    ◦ Difficulty finding luggage upon arrival at the airport.
    ◦ Lack of accessible information for local travel, such as finding reliable, known Bengali drivers/guides for travel within Saudi Arabia (e.g., from Madinah to Makkah). He had to rely on references to find drivers.
    ◦ Complexity of train ticketing for the Makkah-Madinah bullet train, requiring external support.
    ◦ Absence of a comprehensive list or accessible information for Ziyarah (visitation) spots.
• Information accessibility and language barrier:
    ◦ A significant gap was the lack of a single, reliable source for Hajj/Umrah steps according to 'sahih aqida' (correct creed), making it difficult to verify what was right or wrong.
    ◦ Existing apps like Nusuk were primarily in Arabic, and even when translated to English, the 'Explore' option remained in Arabic, making it difficult for non-Arabic speakers to use.
    ◦ The Arabic script itself was often unreadable for Jishan.
    ◦ Lack of digitized guides or FAQs for common questions like number of Tawafs, sequence of actions (Zamzam water vs. prayer), Safa and Marwa starting points, and specific duas for different locations.
    ◦ Reliance on physical books (4-5 books taken for Hajj) which are less convenient than digital formats.
• Mental pressure and group dynamics during Hajj:
    ◦ Hajj is "mentally significantly demanding," and refraining from sins or worldly gossip creates "mental pressure".
    ◦ High expectations from tour operators (selling Hajj at "high end" when actual experience might be 70%) lead to pilgrim dissatisfaction.
    ◦ Negative reactions from a few pilgrims (e.g., dissatisfaction with hotel rooms) can impact the entire group's morale.
• Shopping and local recommendations: No reliable source for finding good shops, understanding fair pricing for items like gold, dates, or clothes, or getting recommendations.
Opportunities / Suggestions – Better guidance, more responsive services, affordable packages.
• Comprehensive Digital Platform:
    ◦ An app that serves as a "single point of contact" for everything related to Hajj and Umrah.
    ◦ It should include clear, step-by-step guides for Ihram, Tawaf, Sa'i, and hair cutting, with rules (mandatory, Sunnah, prohibitions) listed.
    ◦ Tutorial videos, especially for things like tying Ihram, should be included.
    ◦ Interactive Tawaf and Sa'i counters with reminders for duas.
    ◦ A "Dua Companion" with personal, family, and specific duas, and the ability to add custom duas.
    ◦ Offline access to information, as internet can be unreliable.
    ◦ An "Explore" option similar to Trip Advisor, offering information about local places, activities, and services.
    ◦ Integration of flight and hotel booking (OTA) and Haramain train ticketing in the future.
    ◦ A "Hajji Stream" (social media-like platform) for pilgrims to connect, share experiences, and receive real-time information (e.g., Jamarat crowd status) from scholars, influencers, and local guides. This could provide "intelligence or summary" of current crowd situations.
• Enhanced Guidance and Information:
    ◦ Shariah questions/FAQ section, possibly bot-driven or with a helpline service for urgent queries (e.g., regarding 'dam' or validity of actions).
    ◦ Ability to provide guidance according to different schools of thought (e.g., Hanafi vs. Hanbali views on staying in Mina tents) while respecting all viewpoints.
    ◦ Local service provider directory for drivers, guides, and other local services.
    ◦ Audio-visual guides for Ziyarah spots, with recorded audio explaining the significance of places. Integration with QR codes at museums/sites for interactive learning.
    ◦ Local recommendations for shopping (jewelry, food, clothes), including good shops and fair pricing guidance.
• Optimized Training:
    ◦ Short, topic-specific learning videos (3-5 minutes, max 10-15 minutes), unlike long, tedious traditional classes.
    ◦ Modular format with quizzes (like Duolingo) to make learning fun and retain information.
    ◦ On-demand access for pilgrims to refer to information anytime, even at the spot.
• Post-Hajj/Umrah Connection: A connection stream to maintain engagement after the pilgrimage, allowing sharing of memories, receiving reminders, and journaling.
• Monetization Strategy:
    ◦ A freemium model where basic rulings are free, but premium features (location awareness, proprietary research data, audio-visual streams) are paid.
    ◦ Jishan suggests a fair annual premium fee of 20-25 USD for Hajj/Umrah specific features, comparable to travel insurance or small service fees.
    ◦ For the social stream, he suggests a token monthly fee (e.g., 1-2 USD or 100-150 BDT), but prefers annual upfront payments for subscriptions to avoid remembering monthly payments.
Quotes & Memorable Statements – Verbatim; mark [inaudible/best guess].
• "The major gap I felt after my first visit was that we didn't go knowing much about Hajj or Umrah at that time. Or we couldn't study, I mean, we didn't study enough."
• "I felt that if I go with him [Dr. Manjur Elahi], I will be able to perform Hajj in the right and proper way. He will give me the right education."
• (Quoting agency) "We don't sell five-star rooms, we sell for Hajj."
• (Quoting a brother from classes) "Here, the biggest thing is to bear everything with sabr (patience), bear everything with sabr."
• "Hajj is very demanding physically, mentally. So, these other comforts are necessary there."
• "The price we pay in Bangladesh, perhaps you get the best service for that price. But what happens is, I feel that since we are very dependent on guides or people, often discomfort arises and misunderstandings happen."
• "If it's divided into small, small parts, it becomes easier, I think, in terms of learning."
• "Hajj is a commitment. The commitment of Hajj is much greater than that of Umrah by default."
Other Observations – Emotional tone, specific incidents, overall satisfaction level.
• Emotional Tone: Jishan expressed a deep desire for proper religious guidance and preparation for Hajj and Umrah, indicating a spiritual motivation beyond mere travel. He felt significant "comfort" and "confidence" from being well-prepared for Hajj through extensive classes. He also acknowledged the emotional and mental demands of Hajj.
• Specific Incidents:
    ◦ His first Umrah felt "really good" despite the lack of prior study, but he regretted not knowing the "sahih tarika".
    ◦ He registered for Hajj almost two years in advance to allow time for study and preparation.
    ◦ He had a "big transition" in his career, leaving a 19-year job because he felt it was not halal, and paid for his Hajj with halal earnings, which he found "very positive".
    ◦ He described the difficulty of getting lost and tired when walking back to Mina camp after Arafat.
    ◦ He felt "very lost" during his Hajj Umrah when he temporarily lost sight of his Sheikh, despite having prepared beforehand.
• Overall Satisfaction Level: Jishan's satisfaction with his Hajj experience was very high due to the comprehensive preparation and continuous guidance provided by Shepherd's Hajj and the scholars. He felt like "a family" with his Hajj group. While satisfied with the spiritual aspect, he clearly articulated several logistical and informational gaps that, if addressed by a digital platform, would significantly enhance the pilgrim experience. He views improvements by the Saudi government (like the Nusuk app and better airport processes) as positive for pilgrim comfort.

# 16. Moe Fallatah

## # Interview Notes:

Moe Fallatah: A graduate of New York University with a major in computer engineering technology. He began his career in 2018 and has approximately seven years of experience. He is a Senior Business Application specialist with Ilaf Group, where his role primarily involves enhancing business and internal operations through applications.
• Ilaf Group's Business Structure: Operates with two main business lines:
    ◦ Travel: Focuses on booking, making reservations, and purchasing tickets for customers.
    ◦ Hospitality: Manages nine or ten hotels across Saudi Arabia, including four in Mecca, three or four in Medina, and two in Jeddah. These hotels host guests from around the world.
• Moe Fallatah's Role in Operations: Supports Ilaf's hotels by ensuring optimal business performance, particularly in areas related to business applications for both hospitality and travel lines.
Journey / Context
• Muhammad's Research Objective: To gain insights into the operations of a reputable hotel chain like Ilaf, understand the challenges they face, and explore how technology can improve services for everyone in the Hajj and Umrah sector.
• Hotel Operating Environment in Saudi Arabia: Unlike other regions where hotels might directly share through Global Distribution Systems (GDS), Saudi Arabia has specific portals like Nusuk and Makam (government portals). Additionally, customers often prefer to book directly with hotels.
• Customer Booking Channels: Muhammad notes that rooms are sold through diverse channels, including direct hotel bookings, third-party portals (e.g., Booking.com, Agoda), and travel agencies.
• Pricing Management: Ilaf Group has dedicated departments for reservations and services that focus on pricing to ensure competitiveness and customer satisfaction through good service delivery.
• Strategies for Mitigating Pricing Gaps: To address issues arising from layered distribution networks (where customers might pay significantly more than the hotel receives), Ilaf focuses on aligning their prices and contracts with agencies to match their internal reservation office rates. They actively encourage direct bookings via phone, email, or the Ilaf website, supported by their marketing team.
• Agency Partnerships: Ilaf maintains strict pricing policies and limits within their contracts with agencies to ensure standards are met while still allowing agencies to generate revenue.
• Customer Retention Efforts: Key strategies include addressing all customer needs such as transportation, food and beverages, room quality, offering better deals and discounts, providing a warm welcome, and being kind.
• Business Expansion and Scalability: Ilaf's strategy involves maintaining a high reputation, continuously enhancing business and services, and satisfying customer demands. The marketing team plays a crucial role in maintaining their reputation, and customer feedback from surveys is used for continuous improvement.
• Partnership for Business Development: The business development department is responsible for establishing partnerships. Ilaf, having been in business for 30-35 years, is open to collaborating with new agencies and even meeting with the VP of business development.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Earning Customer Loyalty: A major challenge is building customer trust, ensuring repeat business, and becoming their preferred service provider or place of stay.
• Customer Satisfaction Aspects: Challenges include ensuring customers receive the promised service, effective staff management (skills and knowledge), and optimizing sales through appropriate channels.
• Distribution Channel Pricing Discrepancy: A significant challenge is the "layered network" of agents, where end customers for Hajj and Umrah can end up paying up to 50% more than the hotel's actual receiving price. This makes hotel rooms more expensive for customers and reduces Ilaf's revenue.
• Maintaining Reputation and Meeting Demand: The biggest challenge in business expansion and scalability is keeping the company's reputation high amidst numerous competitors. It also involves continuously meeting evolving customer demands.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Direct Booking & Competitive Pricing: Encourage direct bookings via Ilaf's own channels (phone, email, website) and ensure agency contracts are aligned with internal pricing to reduce the price gap for end-users.
• Comprehensive Customer Service: Providing a wide range of services, including transportation, food and beverages, and comfortable rooms, along with offers and discounts, can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
• Leveraging Customer Feedback: Utilizing customer surveys and feedback helps identify areas for improvement and ensures services are continuously enhanced to meet customer needs.
• Strategic Partnerships: Companies like Ilaf are open to creating partnerships with reputable travel agencies and online portals, especially in Muslim countries, through their business development department, to support the Muslim community and expand reach.
• Facilitating Research and Collaboration: Muhammad seeks to connect with executives from the reservation and business development departments to gather more information, which he believes will help expand Ilaf's business and enable direct reservations from various parts of the world.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "Uh I believe it in this kind of business the most important is how to trans your customer, how to make them back to you, how to make them your uh your like your best place to stay or your best uh place of service."
• "So this is the only way I believe that we are uh we are uh we are handling this type of issues." (referring to mitigating the pricing gap by encouraging direct bookings and strict agency contracts)
• "Uh I believe by covering every need that customer would need with uh in the trans transportations, in the food and beverages, even the room, giving them off better offers and discount. Uh make them happy as much as we can in with the hard welcoming, being kind. All of these uh all of these things will give a good affection on any customer."
• "uh in this kind of businesses? I believe it's The biggest challenge is how to keep your your your reput reputation high."
• "The customers demand it's very easy to know and get and as much as you coverage this this demand uh they will be happy and they they return to you."
• "We are always aiming to enhance our business, enhance the services and make our customers happy."
Other Observations
• Consent for Recording: Muhammad sought and received permission to record the meeting for his research.
• Focus on Hajj and Umrah: The conversation is entirely centered on the Hajj and Umrah sector, indicating the specific market and associated logistical and service considerations.
• Role of Technology: Moe Fallatah's role as a "Senior Business Application specialist" highlights Ilaf's emphasis on using applications to enhance business and operations, and he mentions the use of applications in both hospitality and travel business lines.
• Ilaf's Established Presence: Ilaf Group has a long-standing history, being in business for over 30 to 35 years, implying extensive experience and established operations in the sector.
• Willingness to Collaborate: Moe Fallatah expressed a willingness to try and connect Muhammad with the reservations and business development departments, demonstrating openness to external engagement for research and potential partnerships.

# 17. Mohammad Moussa

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Mohamed Moussa is the Co-founder and CTO at Tarteel.
• He is focused on "Building the future of Is".
• His company, Tarteel AI, is described as "one of the best Quran memorisation app". It started as his personal project and has since grown to help "millions of persons worldwide".
Journey / Context
• Mohamed Moussa began his journey while studying at the University of Waterloo, working on side projects to improve his skills.
• He started working on a tool called Ekkra, which later became Tarteel.
• The initial tool aimed to solve his own problem: searching the Quran using voice, as he struggled with Arabic typing and keyboards.
• People were excited about the voice search feature and wanted it to correct recitation, which became a new challenge due to the need for highly accurate speech-to-text technology.
• Tarteel began as an open-source volunteer project with multiple brothers working on it.
• In 2020, they decided to form an actual company to dedicate appropriate time and resources to its growth.
• Two co-founders, including Mohamed Moussa, quit their jobs to work full-time on Tarteel from the end of 2020.
• They raised an initial seed round from Muslim angel investors and then grew the company through bootstrapping.
• Tarteel operates using a freemium model to get users in the door, offering a free tier and free trials, then working on conversion.
• They initially focused on the Hafs recitation, which is used by approximately 90% of Muslims, especially in countries where people pay for such products, seeing it as a sufficiently large market. They aim to support other Qira'at in the future when resources allow.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Proving product-market fit (PMF) is identified as the biggest challenge in the early stage of a startup, not necessarily investment. PMF is defined as whether users will "actually like, like, like use the product in the way that you're intending," specifically whether they will pay for it at the intended price point.
• For Tarteel, the challenge was building the technology to meet the product-market fit, given it is a very technical product, and achieving a level of fidelity where people are comfortable paying for it.
• User expectations regarding free Islamic products: Mohamed Moussa states that "the community holds the mentality" that Islamic products should be free. He observes people on social media questioning subscription costs for such products.
• Focusing too broadly: In the beginning, Tarteel built "a bunch of stuff that didn't really matter," like gamification features (badges, leaderboards). He suggests a main lesson learned is to "really focus on just doing one thing very, very well before you build out all this other like fluff". Users primarily pay for recitation features and mistake detection accuracy, not gamification.
• Data collection and privacy: As a data-driven startup, winning user trust to collect data securely for model training is a challenge, requiring building a trustworthy brand and honouring that trust. Some users still have concerns even with an established company serving millions.
• High costs of AI training: While hosting for inference (production use) can be optimised, the bigger costs are usually training, which involves gathering, managing, and labelling massive amounts of data, and requires GPUs.
• Social responsibility and handling mistakes in sensitive areas (e.g., religious learning): There's a challenge to manage the "cost of the mistake" if an AI tool for Quran recitation, like Tarteel, fails to catch errors, potentially leading to ingrained incorrect learning. Mohammad Moussa emphasizes positioning the product carefully. He warns against AI Islamic products that attempt to give fatawa or answer religious questions without appropriate guidelines and guardrails.
• Changing people's mindset and trust in mobile apps for religious learning: Initially, the idea of learning Quran through a mobile app sounded "absurd". Overcoming skepticism requires building something that actually works. Trust is built slowly, and while some people remain skeptical, it doesn't mean a product can't succeed.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Optimise for shareable experiences: For growth, he suggests creating shareable content that includes branding/attribution. For example, offering to generate du'a as an image carousel or single image for direct sharing to Instagram, with a logo and shortlink.
• Creative attractive video content: Come up with relevant real-world situations where the product (e.g., QaniTeen) is obviously useful and create video content demonstrating its use. An example for QaniTeen is promoting having personal du'a prepared during Ramadan for qiyam.
• Focus on Organic Growth Levers: These are identified as having the "highest impact when it comes to marketing if well executed".
• Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly: For early-stage founders, the advice is to "figure out what matters for your solution, and figure out how to actually produce it, like produce an MVP for that as quickly and early as possible to actually validate what you're doing". This helps avoid spending significant resources before proving user demand (e.g., not collecting data for a year and spending $500,000 before validating).
• Use AI as a tool within processes, not the basis of the product itself: AI tools are valuable for various internal operations like coding (e.g., Cursor), translation of UI strings, brainstorming (e.g., ChatGPT), and customer support flows (e.g., Intercom's Fin, ParaHelp, Chatbase). However, "AI is a tool like within different capacities to achieve certain objectives. It's not what builds your product.". Traditional product management processes (e.g., writing specifications, user research) still apply, with AI used as a helpful tool for research, brainstorming, or note-taking within these processes.
• Strategic Positioning for AI in sensitive domains: For products like Tarteel, positioning is key. Do not claim 100% accuracy. Instead, position the AI tool as a supplement to traditional methods (e.g., working with a teacher), not a replacement. Emphasize incremental value (e.g., Tarteel catches a percentage of mistakes that wouldn't have been caught otherwise, replacing a 0% correction situation).
• Train models with diverse data: To handle variations in recitation (e.g., from Nigeria vs. Pakistan), models should be trained using data from different sources.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "The du'a it produced was good and relevant".
• "It asked me if I want an audio version or pdf of the du'a to keep with me which was helpful".
• "It prioritized providing Arabic through transliteration most of the time, which I actually struggle to read. I would've preferred it ask or default to Arabic letters".
• "I asked it for the pdf and it said it generated it but when I clicked on the link to download I get an error. Same thing happened with the audio".
• "Organic growth levers are the highest impact when it comes to marketing if well executed".
• "Come up with relevant real-world situations in which this GPT is obviously and widely useful and then creative attractive video content about those situations that demonstrates using QaniTeen in that situation".
• "The biggest challenge you have is actually proving product-market fit".
• "Product-market fit isn't whether they like the product. It's whether they'll actually like, like, like use the product in the way that you're intending, like whether they'll pay for it.".
• "AI is a tool like within different capacities to achieve certain objectives. It's not what builds your product.".
• "The processes themselves haven't changed." (referring to product management processes despite AI tool usage).
• "There's minimal AI in the AI training process. The AI is the outcome.".
• "AI is just a helpful tool for summarizing, for finding appropriate context on the internet.".
• "The community holds the mentality [that Islamic products should be free].".
• "Our company specifically has actually shifted that mentality for some people.".
• "We don't position Tartil as being 100% accurate. You'll never hear us say that.".
• "Tartil is positioned as an incremental value add.".
• "You have to actually build something that works, and then it's, it's a slow, it's a slow challenge.".
• "Figure out what is the MVP of what you can build to prove in a month or in three months or whatever is necessary in terms of time to actually get that built, like in a relatively quickly, quick period. How do you actually prove that this is uh going to work properly?".
Other Observations
• Mohamed Moussa is available to re-test the QaniTeen app once asset generation (PDF/audio) is working.
• Tarteel has led a shift in mentality, with many subscribers making Tarteel their first in-app subscription, even their first Islamic subscription.
• Tarteel does not support tajwid (rules of Quranic recitation) at all, focusing on basic recitation correction.
• They advocate for supplementing traditional learning (e.g., with a teacher) with AI tools rather than replacing it.
• The trust in AI generally has varied, with Tarteel starting before a period of widespread skepticism and now experiencing renewed trust.
• The concept of bootstrapping and seeking support from individuals with access to compute clusters (like Stability AI) for expensive AI training costs is a notable strategy.

# 18. Mohammad Rafiuzzaman

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information – Professional background, role in operations and training.
• Rafiuzzaman is part of the management of the Ummah Hajj Portal [22:07].
• He holds the position of head of the entire setup management for the Ummah Hajj Portal [27:42].
• He is also a trainer contracted with One Ummah and is described as a preacher ("dai") from whom many people benefit [27:07].
• Although he has not performed Hajj or Umrah previously, he is scheduled to go for Hajj next year along with the management of the Ummah Hajj Portal, viewing this as a significant part of his career journey and life, a path accepted by Allah [02:02, 22:07].
Journey / Context – Training processes, group management style, coordination efforts.
• A primary objective of their initiative is to deeply connect pilgrims with Mecca and Medina, ensuring they truly feel the significance of these places [29:43].
• They aim to provide pilgrims with a proper understanding that Hajj is a spiritual journey, not merely a trip.
• Rafiuzzaman notes that pilgrims often have high expectations, desiring excellent hotels, close proximity to Haram, and comprehensive transportation facilities.
• For pilgrims who have studied Seerah (biography of the Prophet), there is a strong fascination to visit historical sites associated with Rasulullah (peace be upon him) and his companions [22:45].
• Their group management strategy involves historically connecting pilgrims to significant places in Mecca and Medina, specifically those frequented by the Sahaba, Rasulullah (peace be upon him), Ibrahim (peace be upon him), and his family. This includes briefing pilgrims with historical contexts and stories from the Seerah before visiting these sites [29:43].
Pain Points / Challenges – Common mistakes by pilgrims, logistical hurdles, religious misunderstandings.
• Rafiuzzaman expresses a personal sense of awe and fear about going to the House of Allah as a guest [22:45].
• A key challenge is managing pilgrims' high demands for luxury services (good hotels, close proximity, all transport facilities).
• It is difficult to impress upon pilgrims that Hajj is a spiritual journey, not merely a recreational trip.
• There's a significant challenge in providing complete support and good service at a low or minimum economic cost for pilgrims who have saved money with great difficulty, even by selling land.
• Some pilgrims, despite having foreign citizenship, wish to travel with a Bangladeshi passport and seek advice on the feasibility and process, highlighting potential knowledge gaps regarding travel requirements.
• Physical training sessions are often not effective or accessible for all pilgrims, especially those residing abroad (e.g., Canada-based) or in different domestic locations, due to logistics and timing [24:59, 25:52].
• During on-site guidance in Mecca and Medina, noisy environments and restrictions on microphone usage by authorities pose a challenge to clear communication with large groups [31:07].
Opportunities / Suggestions – Better training tools, improved coordination methods, policy changes.
• Rafiuzzaman strongly believes that technology can play a crucial role in Hajj training modules to prepare pilgrims spiritually and mentally [24:59, 25:52].
• He suggests using platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, or custom-made alternatives that offer a good meeting interface for one-to-one guidance and presentations during training sessions. This would be particularly beneficial for pilgrims unable to attend physical training [25:52].
• For Ziyarah tours and historical connections, he proposes using technological devices, such as ear-type gadgets (similar to a radio system). This would allow guides to speak into a microphone, with pilgrims receiving clear audio, overcoming noise and avoiding issues with police regarding mic use [31:07, 44].
• They are open to hiring external, qualified trainers, including Islamic scholars (Ulama-e-Kiram), to provide comprehensive guidance to their pilgrims, rather than solely relying on their internal staff [27:42].
• He supports the idea of a post-Hajj boot camp, lasting at least one month or even a year, with regular (monthly or bi-monthly) check-ins for pilgrims, to help sustain the spiritual essence of Hajj [39:20].
Quotes & Memorable Statements – Verbatim; mark [inaudible/best guess].
• "Firstly, going to the House of Allah as a guest of Allah, there's a good fear that I will have the opportunity to go to such a place of Allah." [22:45]
• "Whether we can properly make them understand that this is a spiritual journey and that they need to take it that way, that is a challenging issue for us, to make them feel that."
• "our challenge is to provide them with complete support and good service at a low cost or at the minimum economic level."
• "technology will definitely play a good role. Be it Zoom, Meet, or any kind of custom-made platform if it comes that gives us a good meeting interface and allows us to provide one-to-one guidance to pilgrims through good presentations. If such technology is better than Zoom, I hope it will be very good for us to train them up."
• "we want to give our best in this field so that pilgrims can feel why they are going for Hajj." [29:43]
• "when we connect them historically to these places, after giving a brief beforehand, relating a story from the Seerah (biography of the Prophet) or what happened at that time in that place, yes, you know, we are going to a place whose history is this, which is related to this verse of the Quran, there are related Hadith, the Sahaba used to think this way - after giving such a brief, when we go to the place, then a... ...we can use a device technologically if it's good for us." [29:43, 31:07]
• "So, there won't be a noisy situation like using a loudspeaker or anything like that. I'll be talking, and my pilgrims will hear me clearly. Yes, they will be watching and connecting with my words. This technology can be a very good asset for all these connections." [31:07]
Other Observations – Attitudes toward tech use, cultural considerations.
• Rafiuzzaman demonstrates a positive and proactive attitude towards leveraging technology to enhance the Hajj experience, particularly for training and on-site guidance [25:52, 29:43].
• He is aware of the diverse geographical locations of pilgrims and how technology can bridge the gap for those who cannot attend in-person sessions [25:52].
• He shows an understanding of the financial constraints faced by many pilgrims, emphasizing the importance of providing high-quality service within an affordable price range.
• He recognizes the need to shift pilgrims' perspectives from viewing Hajj merely as a "trip" to understanding it as a profound "spiritual journey".
• He is mindful of local regulations and cultural sensitivities, such as police restrictions on microphone usage in certain areas, and proposes technological solutions to circumvent such issues while maintaining effective communication [31:07].

# 20. Mustafizur Rahman

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Interviewee: Mohammad Mostafizur Rahman, who works in the IT department of an Islamic bank and is in charge of information security.
• Pilgrimage Type(s) and Year(s):
    ◦ Obligatory Hajj: Performed in 2014.
    ◦ Badali Hajj (Hajj performed on behalf of someone else): Performed in 2022.
    ◦ Umrah: Has not been performed personally, but there are plans to go for Umrah.
Journey / Context
• Travel Planning and Service Providers (2014 Hajj):
    ◦ Mustafiz initially contacted his mosque's former Imam.
    ◦ The Imam arranged passport and visa, but did not provide complete information about accommodation (Madinah or Makkah), activities, departure times, or flights.
    ◦ Visa and tickets were often issued at the very last moment, sometimes even the day before Hajj.
    ◦ No proper training system was in place through the agency; training consisted of a short sermon one day before Hajj, which was insufficient for such a "massive activity".
    ◦ Mustafiz gained knowledge through personal "sources" – friends who had gone before, and a social worker named Jahid Bhai in Siddheshwari.
    ◦ He received significant help and "beautiful descriptions" of Hajj from Dr. Abdullah Hel Baki of Jahangirnagar University, who also taught free Quran lessons.
    ◦ The agency provided "nothing" in terms of guidance; everything learned was through Baki Sir and Jahid Bhai.
• Travel Planning and Service Providers (2022 Hajj):
    ◦ Mustafiz's wife selected the Shepherd agency.
    ◦ They received "very good training" and "excellent" guidance from Shepherd.
    ◦ Shepherd included religious scholars in their marketing and provided "superb" guidance, making it "very effective for someone going for the first time".
Pain Points / Challenges
• Lack of Proper Guidance and Training (Overall):
    ◦ In 2014, there was "no proper guidance regarding Hajj" from traditional agencies; they had "very traditional activities" and "no conventional training".
    ◦ This led to pilgrims, especially from rural areas, being unable to perform many Hajj rituals correctly due to lack of knowledge.
    ◦ Mustafiz emphasised that "the training part before going for Hajj should be completed most thoroughly".
    ◦ Training should encompass both "logistical training and spiritual training". Logistical training is crucial for those unfamiliar with air travel, airports, or even air-conditioned buses, as there are "many steps" and "at least a hundred places" requiring patience. Lack of logistical support can lead to a "bad name" for Bangladesh and "many mistakes".
• Last-Minute Visa and Ticket Issuance:
    ◦ Both in 2014 and 2022, "tickets and visas arrived at the very last moment," sometimes only "one or two days before". This was a "complex" issue.
• Airport Waiting Times and Conditions:
    ◦ In 2014, Mustafiz had a "very bad experience" waiting for "almost 16 hours" in Jeddah airport.
    ◦ The Jeddah airport conditions were "so bad that the toilets were overflowing, and water was all over the floor," making ablution difficult over "dirty water". This was not experienced in 2022 due to improvements.
• Fatigue and Lack of Rest Before Umrah:
    ◦ After the long journey, pilgrims are "so exhausted" upon hotel check-in.
    ◦ Some agencies immediately proceed to Umrah performance without allowing "some rest," which is "tough" without it.
• Pilgrim Nervousness and Getting Lost:
    ◦ Pilgrims, especially first-timers, are "very nervous" about performing Umrah.
    ◦ Mustafiz shared an anecdote of an elder sister in 2024 who got lost for "five or six hours" after getting separated from her group and having no SIM card inserted in her phone.
    ◦ Panic due to separation during Tawaf or Sa'i is a concern, with pilgrims not knowing where to meet.
    ◦ Network data is "often not available inside the mosque," making "location tracking a bit difficult".
• Mobile Network Connectivity:
    ◦ Pilgrims often don't insert a local SIM immediately or go for Umrah without it due to agency hurrying.
    ◦ An anecdote from 2024 highlighted a Haji who missed the bus at Quba Mosque because he decided not to buy a SIM, causing distress and hassle for the group. Another pious individual kept his mobile off, leading to communication issues.
• Carrying Books for Duas:
    ◦ Mustafiz used memorised duas and small books.
    ◦ However, carrying books, especially those with Quranic verses, can be "a bit disrespectful" if placed on the ground while praying.
• Physical Challenges during Hajj Days:
    ◦ The main problems during Hajj days were "physical supports," such as walking to the bus, tracking roads, gathering for stoning rituals, and knowing how many stones to throw.
    ◦ Bus schedules were "missed repeatedly" on the Day of Arafat, leading to groups being separated or stuck for long hours (e.g., 3 AM bus stuck due to traffic in 2014).
    ◦ Long queues at toilets in Madinah are a common issue.
• Luggage Management:
    ◦ A significant problem is that "luggage doesn't arrive" or gets "lost or go[es] to the wrong place," especially with fragmented flights across agencies. The new "Makkah Initiative" involves luggage being checked in Dhaka and picked up directly at the hotel, which can complicate matters if flights are not full with a single agency.
• Frequent Hotel Shifting:
    ◦ In 2022, Mustafiz experienced "frequent travel and shifting" of hotels, including four hotel shifts (Makkah to Aziziyah, Madinah, back to Aziziyah, then near Ibrahim Khalil Road).
    ◦ This involved "dragging and moving so much luggage," which was "very tough". He noted that while Aziziyah is a good concept for the core Hajj days (5 days), agencies often keep pilgrims there for longer (7-10 days), which is problematic.
    ◦ Muhammad explained this is due to Saudi hotel owners selling "hotel slots in chunks," making it difficult for agencies to book flexible durations.
• Transportation in Makkah and Madinah:
    ◦ Mustafiz believes transportation in Makkah and Madinah has "always been a problem" and suggested agencies work with muallems (Hajj guides).
• Carrying Excessive Dry Food:
    ◦ Pilgrims from Bangladesh "take excessive dry food with them," which is "not really necessary" as "all food is available there". This unnecessarily makes luggage heavy.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Comprehensive Training and Preparation:
    ◦ "Proper training is necessary". This should include both logistical and spiritual aspects.
    ◦ Online training is "definitely possible" and sufficient, as most people are now "accustomed to online platforms," even in villages. Remote training would not pose a problem as it does not require "hands-on" teaching.
• Mental Preparation for Waits:
    ◦ Pilgrims should be "mentally prepared" for "long waits" as it "often makes things easier".
    ◦ Motivation should be provided so pilgrims can "sit and wait patiently" while remembering Allah.
• Technology for Ritual Guidance and Confidence:
    ◦ Increase people's confidence through "mock exercises, quizzes" (e.g., "What will you recite upon entering?", "How many times will you circumambulate?", "What is the dua for Sa'i?").
    ◦ Develop a mobile app for Hajj and Umrah guidance.
    ◦ The app should provide "step-by-step guidance through videos" for rituals like Umrah, enabling pilgrims to be "self-dependent".
    ◦ Include a "panic button" for lost pilgrims, with Arabic text explaining their situation to Saudi authorities or police.
    ◦ The app should guide pilgrims to meeting points if separated and help them find their way back to the hotel.
    ◦ It could allow communication with family or support personnel in Bangladesh.
    ◦ The app should contain all necessary duas for Hajj and Umrah. This would eliminate the need to carry physical books, which can be cumbersome and potentially disrespectful.
• Enhanced Connectivity:
    ◦ Pilgrims should "ensure their mobile SIM card immediately after landing in Jeddah" to be "under network coverage". Agencies should enforce this.
    ◦ Provide an eSIM plan or recommend pre-purchased roaming SIMs (e.g., from BanglaLink, Grameenphone, Robi, Airtel) for a short duration (1-2 days) from Bangladesh, allowing pilgrims to buy a local SIM later.
• Logistical Support and Tracking:
    ◦ Agencies should allow "some rest" before performing Umrah after a long journey.
    ◦ Arrangements for vehicles for "disabled or elderly" pilgrims from Arafat to Muzdalifah should be defined by agencies.
    ◦ Implement luggage trackers (like location trackers) in the app, allowing pilgrims to track their luggage. Agencies could also use these trackers for their main luggage lots.
    ◦ Agency owners could use trackers in their buses to monitor their location and route.
• Informative and Gamified Maps:
    ◦ Create an app feature with a map or list of "various spots for making dua" in Makkah, Madinah, and Arafat.
    ◦ This could be a "gamified object," where pilgrims get "benefits" for visiting and praying at these locations.
    ◦ Include "audio-visual cues" explaining the historical or religious significance and virtues of these places with "authentic narrations".
    ◦ Add locations of important landmarks like the well near Quba Mosque, highlighting their tranquility and significance.
• Guidance on Local Purchases:
    ◦ The app could provide guidance on where to buy goods like dates, jewellery, souvenirs, and perfumes, reducing pressure on agency staff.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "So, they told me the first step is to really find the real pain points in the Hajj and Umrah industry".
• "Since you have performed Hajj twice, preparation is very important".
• "The challenges were that when I went in 2014, I felt that there was no proper guidance regarding Hajj at that time".
• "But in one day, such a massive activity like Hajj cannot be trained".
• "So, at that time, we faced these issues, realizing that proper training is necessary".
• "We couldn't learn anything from our agency. The agency didn't guide us at all".
• "I think the training part before going for Hajj should be completed most thoroughly in our country, and attention should be given to this".
• "But especially the logistical support is very crucial. Because of these, our country gets a bad name, and many mistakes are made".
• "So, I don't think there's any problem with remote training".
• "The first thing, the problem I faced right from the beginning of the Hajj journey, was that our tickets and visas arrived at the very last moment".
• "But I think some rest is needed here. Because after such a long journey, it becomes tough to perform Umrah without rest".
• "It is possible that there could be long waits, so you should be mentally prepared".
• "Increase people's confidence".
• "The app should be designed so they can perform it alone, becoming self-dependent".
• "And a big problem there is that network data is often not available inside the mosque, so location tracking becomes a bit difficult".
• "I think they should ensure their mobile SIM card immediately after landing in Jeddah".
• "The biggest problem during the days of Hajj is that on the spiritual side, I didn't see any problem in terms of worship. There's ample opportunity for worship. But the problem is with the physical supports".
• "One big problem for both agencies and pilgrims is that luggage doesn't arrive".
• "Actually, regarding Hajj matters, nobody likes anything paid... But for Bangladeshi pilgrims, it should be free".
Other Observations
• Shepherd Agency's Positive Impact: Shepherd agency in 2022 provided good training and guidance, including religious scholars, which was highly effective for first-time pilgrims. Mustafiz believes some agencies like Shepherd are improving the Hajj experience in Bangladesh.
• Conditions of Grassroots Pilgrims: Mustafiz noted that the condition of pilgrims from "rural areas or districts is truly pathetic" as they often "can't perform many of the Hajj rituals correctly, or they don't know or understand".
• Cultural Tendency for Excessive Dry Food: Bangladeshi pilgrims often carry "excessive dry food" like puffed rice, making luggage heavy, despite food being readily available in Makkah. This practice could be discouraged with proper guidance.
• "Shifting Packages" and Hotel Control: The practice of "shifting packages" and frequent hotel changes is a common issue for agencies globally, as Saudi hotel owners sell "hotel slots in chunks," limiting agencies' flexibility in booking durations.
• Perception of Paid Services for Hajj: Mustafiz believes that services related to Hajj should be free for pilgrims, particularly for Bangladeshis, as it is considered "Sadaqa Jariya" (ongoing charity). He suggests that a paid app might be acceptable for non-Bangladeshi users but not for those from Bangladesh.

# 21. Obaidur Rahman

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
Abu Yusuf Obaidur Rahman is in the 35-45 age group and is a current resident of Canada. He has performed Umrah five times, all within a concentrated period between August and December of the previous year. During these pilgrimages, he was living in Madina and working as a teacher.
Journey / Context
Obaidur Rahman's Umrah trips were primarily self-organised because he was a resident of Madina, making it very easy for him to arrange his own transportation and accommodation. He relied heavily on "peer reviews" from other long-time residents or citizens of Madina for recommendations on hotels and transportation (e.g., bus or taxi stops).
On one occasion, he travelled with co-workers on a "luxurious bus" that was organised and paid for by anonymous sponsors, where the pilgrim groups never knew the sponsor or the cost. Other times, his transport options included driving with a friend or using public transport from private rental companies that offered "Bombi". He also used public taxi spots with co-workers.
During his trips, he travelled with his family, including his spouse and three children, the youngest of whom was three years old.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Transportation Issues:
    ◦ Many pilgrims, particularly foreigners, perceive taxi companies as engaging in "extortion" due to high prices, especially for travel within Makkah and Madina, and for intercity travel. Obaidur Rahman, as a local, did not face this issue as a "rampant regularity" because he knew the reasonable prices and was able to bargain effectively.
    ◦ The unmarked and unregistered private taxi vehicles (which operate without official Uber/Kareem signs but offer chauffeur services) pose a reliability and safety challenge for foreign pilgrims, who might worry about being taken to wrong or "weird areas".
    ◦ While Uber and Kareem operate in Madina, they are "somewhat already doing that" for local travel, they are not available in Makkah or for intercity transport. Furthermore, Uber and Kareem are perceived to be more expensive than what a local taxi driver would charge.
    ◦ Road closures, particularly during Salah times, in Makkah and Madina, create significant logistical challenges, especially for families with young children, requiring long and unexpected walks if pilgrims are not prepared or aware of the alternative routes.
• Accommodation Issues:
    ◦ A significant complaint is the discrepancy between advertised hotel star ratings (e.g., two, three, four-star) and the actual quality of service, which is often "really bad".
    ◦ Pilgrims frequently encounter booking issues, such as hotels having no reservation found or being overbooked upon arrival, leading to considerable "hassle for foreigner[s]".
    ◦ To mitigate these issues, foreigners often "spend a lot of money and go to these hotels that are renowned with these booking issues" as a safer option, as they lack the opportunity to "shop around" like locals.
    ◦ A "pyramid scheme" in hotel booking, where properties are sold through multiple intermediaries, leads to prices becoming "like 50% more than what the hotel owner get paid".
• Geographical, Logistical, and Information Gaps:
    ◦ Geographical confusion during rituals, such as knowing "exactly which door to enter from," "which way to turn," and identifying the "most convenient" washrooms for performing Sa'i.
    ◦ A lack of detailed geographical information (e.g., distances in kilometers or meters for walks) prevents pilgrims from mentally and physically preparing for their journeys.
    ◦ Difficulty in finding suitable shopping and food places, especially for families with young children, often results in choosing the closest and least effort-intensive options rather than optimal ones.
    ◦ The "biggest challenge Saudi Arabia particularly is a linguistic challenge". Essential information, such as average restaurant prices or locations for specific commodities and souvenirs, is predominantly in Arabic, with inadequate or inaccurate English translations online.
    ◦ The authenticity of information regarding historical and religious sites is a concern. Local drivers or guides often provide information based on hearsay rather than official or "accredited" sources, leading to unverified claims (e.g., about specific wells) due to a lack of government signage.
    ◦ Challenges in locating basic necessities for families with young children, such as baby carriers, baby food, wipes, or diapers, often requiring extensive and fruitless searches.
• Post-Pilgrimage Spiritual Maintenance:
    ◦ Pilgrims often experience a decline in their spiritual high after returning home and resuming daily routines.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Enhanced Digital Platforms for Convenience and Transparency:
    ◦ Transportation App: An "amazing platform" where taxi drivers and public transport companies could post their charges, allowing customers to easily find the right price for their trips.
    ◦ Reliability App for Private Taxis: A new app providing "a little bit of reliability" for private taxis would be a "game changer" by addressing safety concerns for foreigners.
    ◦ Direct Hotel Booking Platform: A platform where hotel owners could directly advertise and communicate with customers (B2C) would "certainly reduce the hassle" and potentially lower prices by eliminating intermediaries. Hotel owners would likely embrace such a "shortcut" if it ensures the "least amount of cash" hassle.
• Comprehensive Digital Guidance and Information:
    ◦ Geographical and Logistical Guide: An app or service that provides precise geographical information (e.g., "walk of this many meters" between points) to help pilgrims prepare mentally and physically.
    ◦ Food and Shopping Guide: Information on the best places for food and shopping, including average prices and cuisines, particularly in English, would greatly benefit pilgrims.
    ◦ Audio-Activated Panel for Ziara (Visiting Historical Sites): An app with an audio-activated panel near significant areas that explains their historical and religious importance would be "amazing" and a "game changer", providing "accredited" information to pilgrims not using tour operators.
    ◦ Family Logistics Support: Information on the best places to buy baby necessities (food, wipes, diapers, carriers) closest to the pilgrim's accommodation.
    ◦ Dietary Recommendations: Suggestions from medical professionals or dieticians on suitable foods (e.g., avoiding deep-fried or spicy options) and where to find them, considering the physical demands of the pilgrimage.
    ◦ Offline Ritual App: An offline mobile app containing all necessary duas and ritual steps, alongside authentic information, would be "100% more beneficial" than traditional pen and paper, aligning with the Saudi government's shift towards digital tools (e.g., Nusuk app).
• Post-Pilgrimage Spiritual Reminders:
    ◦ Instead of lengthy coaching programs, daily or weekly notifications that serve as "memory milestones" (similar to Meta or phone photo throwbacks) could remind pilgrims of their Umrah experience. This approach, based on "sentiment or the emotions of having been there," would have an "emotional impact" and fuel continued spiritual engagement through reminders, articles, verses, or hadith, without requiring significant commitment.
• App Monetisation and Pricing:
    ◦ Obaidur Rahman would be "comfortable paying" for a "one-stop shop" app that offers convenience and comparable prices to self-arrangement.
    ◦ For a lifetime service app providing comprehensive Hajj/Umrah guidance (geography, logistics tips, rituals, duas), he would be willing to pay between $25 and $50 USD, depending on the range of services offered.
    ◦ For a one-year subscription, a price range of $10 to $20 USD would be considered fair.
• Regulatory Environment:
    ◦ The "biggest issue" for foreign companies seeking to operate in Saudi Arabia is the "language barrier" when communicating with government officials responsible for regulations.
    ◦ However, the Saudi government has a "big motivation" to support the tech sector as part of its "Vision 2030". A well-pitched tech idea that is "feasible" and "beneficial for pilgrims" and the "local population" would likely find government support.

• "100% not a pen and pencil way. Uh given the Saudi government has paid most things to be used by app right now."
• "...rather if somebody who has finished their Omra and they're returning to their home country if they could be reminded through daily or weekly notifications about their experience of their home. It could be given some sort of memory milestones."
• "Something that is based on the sentiment or the emotions of having been there."
Other Observations
• The interview was conducted and transcribed entirely in English.
• Obaidur Rahman's demanding job in Madina limited his ability to extensively explore industry regulations or connections.
• There is a general human preference for "convenience" and "one-stop shops," influencing the adoption of services like those offered by Walmart and fast-food companies.
• He highlighted the effectiveness of sentimental "memory milestones" in consumer technology, such as photo throwbacks on Meta, Android, and Apple devices, as a model for post-pilgrimage spiritual engagement.

# 22. Omar Faruk

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information – Pilgrim
• Pilgrimage Type(s) and Year(s): Omar performed Hajj last year (from the interview's perspective, likely 2023). His Hajj was his first experience travelling to Makkah and Madinah, and the Umrah was performed as part of that Hajj. Hajj became obligatory for him in 2020 after his father passed away, due to inherited land that met the financial requirement. However, he could not perform Hajj in 2020, 2021, or 2022 due to the COVID-19 lockdown and a career shift that left him unemployed.
• Trip Format: Omar went for Hajj with his mother. He travelled with the agency "Shephard".
• Professional Background: Omar is a software engineer, and his education is in IT.
Journey / Context – Travel planning, agency involvement, notable events
• Initial Obligation and Delays: Hajj became obligatory in 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and his personal career transition (where he became "100% unemployed"), he could not perform Hajj in 2020, 2021, or 2022. He even admitted that he had "honestly didn't even remember Hajj" due to being busy with other matters.
• Motivation and Financial Preparation: In 2023, Naim Bhai reminded him about his Hajj obligation and encouraged him to make the intention, saying it would make it "easy". Omar was initially concerned about the large financial amount (5-6 lakh taka) needed, as he could barely save money. Naim Bhai's suggestion to do a pre-registration for a smaller amount (23,000 or 24,300 taka) and the assurance that he could go next year if unable to go that year significantly helped him overcome the initial hurdle. His mother, despite being sick and having foot problems, was resolute on going with him, stating, "If you don't take me with you, no one else will. My Hajj won't happen. Somehow or another, I will go". The necessary funds were gradually managed, including selling a piece of land, even though his office did not provide any financial support and actually cut his salary.
• Physical Preparation: While some advised walking several miles, Omar's job pressure and his mother's illness made this difficult. He opted for alternative methods like Hijama for his mother, and her mental preparedness also facilitated the journey.
• Spiritual Preparation (Learning):
    ◦ An initial Tablighi event session, while attended, provided only about "10% benefit" in terms of learning the actual Hajj and Umrah procedures.
    ◦ A significant and "very fruitful" learning experience came from a Hajj training session at As-Sunnah Foundation with Sheikh Ahmadullah. Omar learned about this training from Iftekhar Bhai during his medical tests for the Hajj visa. He immediately registered for both himself and his mother.
    ◦ This interactive training, led by scholars who regularly perform Hajj (like Sheikh Ahmadullah), taught them "practically" through presentations and maps, making it easy for his mother to understand without separate instruction.
    ◦ Omar had to personally manage slight differences between his Hanafi Mazhab and the Fiqh followed by Shephard.
• Agency Selection: Omar chose Shephard based on Naim Bhai's strong recommendation, trusting Naim Bhai's positive experience from the previous year, rather than knowing Shephard directly ("I don't know Shephard, I know you"). He also informally inquired about Shephard and received positive reviews. Omar acknowledged that the agency's primary role is logistical support (travel, hotel, food, time management), not religious guidance.
• Pre-Flight Travel: They arrived in Dhaka the day before their night flight, staying in a hotel after a night train journey, and entered the Hajj camp in the afternoon. Shephard handled all subsequent arrangements.
• Du'a at Arafah: Omar was able to perform Du'a (supplication) effectively at Arafah by finding a secluded spot outside his tent where he was unknown. He did not write down his Du'as but had them memorised, having practiced them during Tawaf throughout their ample time during the early days of Hajj. He also used Hisnul Muslim on his mobile for generic Du'as from the Quran and Hadith.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Financial Uncertainty: Omar faced significant challenges in arranging the funds for Hajj, which he initially estimated at "6 lakh taka, or let's say 5 lakh taka," especially as he had debt and struggled to save. He eventually had to sell land to manage the costs.
• Ineffective Pre-Hajj Ritual Training: The initial Hajj training Omar attended provided only "10% benefit" in learning the procedures of Hajj and Umrah, forcing him to seek additional, more effective training later.
• Communication Gaps from Agency:
    ◦ Omar experienced lack of critical information regarding the duration of stay in Makkah and Madinah from Shephard. This led to confusion about his status as 'Muqim' (resident) or 'Musafir' (traveller) and resulted in him mistakenly performing shortened (Qasr) prayers initially.
    ◦ There was a mix-up regarding bus seating for his mother during Ziyarah trips in Madinah.
    ◦ He notes that current agency communication methods (like WhatsApp groups or dinner briefings) are "absolutely not effective" for keeping all pilgrims aware of "every event".
• Ritual Navigation Difficulties: Pilgrims can "forget things" or "get lost" while performing Umrah.
• Elderly and Crowding Challenges: During the Hajj days, logistical challenges included difficulties for the elderly, severe crowding, and the risk of getting lost, particularly when moving from Muzdalifah to Jamarat for stoning.
• Dependence on Personal Referrals for Trust: Omar found it difficult to select a trustworthy agency without a personal referral, indicating that even transparent documentation might not suffice for building trust compared to a known contact. He views app-based reviews as "emotional" and prone to manipulation, thus not fair or reliable.
• Distraction from Technology during Spiritual Acts: Omar strongly believes that using a mobile app for Du'a (supplication) during spiritual moments like Arafah would be an "interruption" and prevent a "connection with Allah". He prefers a "100% relaxed mode" without mobile interaction for true internal Du'a.
Opportunities / Suggestions
Omar, having considered developing his own Hajj app, offered several suggestions for an app-based solution:
• Comprehensive Notification System (Core Feature): An app should send notifications for all Hajj events. This includes common, platform-handled announcements (e.g., pre-registration deadlines, flight start dates) and agency-specific announcements (e.g., individual flight details, bus numbers, meal times). This would ensure pilgrims are "aware of every event" and reduce confusion.
• Interactive Checklist: Implement a dynamic checklist for pilgrims, covering everything from pre-Hajj preparations (e.g., managing finances, visa, pre-registration) to learning rituals (e.g., how to wear Ihram, perform Tawaf). The checklist items should automatically update, indicating progress and providing "tooltips" or "links" for guidance and quizzes for knowledge retention.
• Digital Muallim (Ritual Guidance): Provide a sequential list of steps for rituals like Umrah (Ihram, Niyyat, Tawaf, Salah, Sa'i). By following these app-based instructions, pilgrims "wouldn't have to follow any Muallim" and "the app itself would become their Muallim," preventing forgetfulness or getting lost during performance.
• Emergency Support: A feature for pilgrims to instantly alert their agency if they are lost ("I am Lost" button), allowing the agency to track their location and send help. Additionally, an emergency support team (offline) to provide instant suggestions for ritual mistakes (e.g., "what to do if someone forgot to pray two rak'ahs after Tawaf"). Omar prefers direct consultation with scholars for complex Fiqh issues over AI, citing concerns about AI's ability to discern Fiqh schools and potential errors in critical religious matters.
• Location Tracking: Allow agencies to track the "exact location of each and every pilgrim" who has the app installed. Pilgrims could also view the locations of others in their group or nearby, facilitating meet-ups. This feature would include "pin-point location" within the Haram area.
• Streamlined Information: For logistical challenges (like crowding or movement), Omar believes that technical solutions are limited, but "information can be streamed more efficiently" through the app. He considers Muhammad's idea of crowd-sourced intelligence (real-time updates on Haram/Mataf/Masa'a congestion) potentially beneficial, allowing pilgrims to navigate more effectively.
• Purpose-Driven App Scope: Omar believes an app should stick to its "core focus" (Hajj-related services) and not expand into broader logistical services like booking taxis or self-guided tours with taxi services. He views these as "another direction" that would require "separate management" and deviate from the app's primary purpose. However, he would consider including "authentic narrations" and "historical information" (text, audio, or video) about significant locations (e.g., Kaaba, Ta'if) if it auto-plays when a pilgrim is at that specific location.
• Post-Hajj Support (Limited Scope): While Muhammad suggested post-Hajj features like spiritual reminders, monthly check-ins, or social support groups to maintain Hajj's transformative spirit, Omar considers these to fall into "another category" not directly tied to Hajj itself. He believes such activities (e.g., improving good deeds) are for all Muslims, not just those who performed Hajj, and an app user might feel they no longer need the Hajj app after returning.
• Agency Trust Building: While not endorsing app-based reviews, Omar suggests that agencies build trust through "popular faces" (celebrities/influencers) who can "blindly recommend" them, as people tend to trust such endorsements more than traditional religious figures (like a mosque Imam) or potentially manipulated online reviews. He strongly emphasises that personal trust and familiarity with an agency are paramount, even willing to pay "10,000 taka more" for a known and trusted agency (Shephard) over a cheaper, less familiar one, even with verified documents, to ensure "peace of mind".
• App Monetization Model: Omar believes "Bangladeshi people don't pay to use apps yet". His preferred model is to charge agencies a "subscription fee" based on the number of pilgrims they manage through the app.
• Pilgrim's Willingness to Pay: Omar stated he would pay for the app as an "optional add-on" if his agency recommends it and takes responsibility for its service. He would be willing to pay "up to 2000 taka" for the app if it ensures a "smooth" 40-day Hajj journey, considering the overall cost of Hajj (4-5 lakh taka).
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "No, my Hajj was my first. Meaning, going to Makkah and Madinah was my first time. Umrah happened during that Hajj itself. So, that was the first, that was the last. If Allah grants me the opportunity, I will go again."
• "[Naim Bhai]: Brother, make an intention. If you make the intention, it will become easy for you."
• "[Omar]: Okay brother, I'll register with 300 taka. It's not a very big amount, I can do it. But what if I register and can't go this year?"
• "[Naim Bhai]: It's okay if you can't go, you'll go next year. It's not a rule that you have to go if you register. You'll just have a registration number."
• "[Omar’s mother]: No, if you go, I will definitely go. If you don't take me with you, no one else will. My Hajj won't happen. Somehow or another, I will go. I mean, however you can, arrange the money for me."
• "[Omar to Naim Bhai]: Brother, I don't know Shephard, I know you."
• "If you develop an app, you'll find many types of users, no doubt about that. But personally, what I'm saying is, I would never pay money to the app directly."
• "The app itself would become their Muallim, a digital Muallim."
• "I am not in favor of AI, not in favor of AI for the reason that if I ask a question to AI, it will ask me which fiqh I follow or which school of thought I follow."
• "If AI makes a mistake when something goes wrong, then you really don't have a chance to correct it. In that case, I think it's better to go directly to a scholar."
• "No, what's currently there is absolutely not effective. I already told you that I want every pilgrim to be aware of every event."
• "Actually, this is about your spiritual matter. Here, an app would interrupt you. Actually, an app cannot help you here. I think that when it comes to acts of worship, involving an app here would cause more interruption."
• "If you're looking at your mobile, your connection with Allah will never truly be there... I'm completely in a relaxed mode, 100% relaxed. That's when my true Du'a will come from within. If I'm looking at a mobile and it's instructing me, I think that itself is an interruption."
• "If it came to features for my app, I wouldn't add this [location-specific overview for self-guided tours]. I wouldn't add it because it doesn't align with the purpose of this app. I mean, it's going in another direction."
• "When I've finished Hajj and come back, as a Muslim, a servant of Allah, of course, I need to increase my good deeds. But the fact that I need to increase my good deeds or improve myself is not exactly tied to Hajj anymore."
• "But for me, it's like, 'Brother, I'll pay the agency. Let the agency worry as much as they need to worry. I'll follow them. I don't want to deal with so much hassle now. Even if it costs me 20,000 taka extra.'"
• "Personally, I would not go for such reviews. Because the reviews people give are entirely emotional... Sometimes, I don't find the reviews fair."
• "It's useless even if the Imam of the mosque says so. Because it is often seen that after listening to the Imam of the mosque, even if someone goes with an agency, they face a lot of trouble during Hajj. This is happening quite often."
• "No, I would still prefer Shephard." (When comparing a known agency with a new transparent one charging 10k less)
• "I can't give you any logical background for this. I mean, I would feel, if they take 10,000 taka more, let them take it, I'm going safe, that's what it is."
• "Trust is important. I went with them, they know me, I know them. I don't want to get introduced to new people now and be in tension whether they are actually good or not, what happens mid-way, whether they will support me or not. I don't want to take these hassles now. Now, brother, take 10,000 taka extra, let me perform my rituals peacefully. That's what I want now."
• "Okay, first of all, I won't pay any money. Bangladeshi people don't pay to use apps yet."
• "If the agency is involved with the app and the agency takes responsibility for it, then I will use it."
• "I would be willing to pay up to 2000 taka. Because if I perform Hajj for 4 lakh, 5 lakh taka, then 2000 taka doesn't seem like too much for my Hajj to be smooth."
Other Observations – Emotional or spiritual reflections, cultural notes
• Omar's mother showed strong determination to perform Hajj with him despite her health issues, seeing it as her only chance for Hajj.
• The interactive learning experience from scholars, using presentations and maps, was highly effective for Omar and his mother, highlighting the value of practical, hands-on teaching in spiritual preparation.
• Omar's personal preference for a "100% relaxed mode" during spiritual acts like Du'a, without the "interruption" of an app, indicates a strong emphasis on genuine, undisturbed spiritual connection.
• He is skeptical of online reviews for agency selection, considering them "emotional" and prone to manipulation. This reflects a cultural preference for personal referrals and established trust over anonymous digital feedback in high-stakes decisions like Hajj.
• He believes that "popular faces" or "celebrities" hold more sway in agency recommendations than religious figures like Imams, indicating the influence of modern marketing trends in the Hajj and Umrah industry in Bangladesh.
• His firm stance on not paying for apps as a Bangladeshi user, but being willing to pay if an agency recommends and stands behind it, suggests a cultural expectation for apps to be free or included as part of a service package. He indicates that the psychological barrier to paying for an app is high for Bangladeshis, even if the amount is small relative to the overall Hajj cost.

# 24. Reza Waheed

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Hajj: Reza performed Hajj for the first time in 2025, travelling with the agency "Sheppard".
• Umrah: He performed Umrah in 2021.
• Travel Style: His Hajj trip was guided by an agency. His Umrah trip was self-guided/individual.
Journey / Context
• Hajj Preparation: Reza found the lecture sessions with Sheppard very helpful for mental and physical preparation before Hajj. He specifically highlighted four acts taught in these sessions—Adab, Sbor, Shukr, and Istegfar—which significantly aided him during difficult situations during Hajj. The Hajj app could include a Hajj preparation section with audio lectures (preferred) and written text to help pilgrims prepare mentally and physically.
• Umrah Travel Arrangements:
    ◦ Hotel Booking: Reza booked his hotels for Umrah online, likely through platforms like booking.com or Expedia.com. He found the process smooth and did not face any challenges, noting that hotel apps are specialised for hotel bookings. His hotel was a 12-15 minute walking distance from the Haram, which he considered reasonable for the price, as it eliminated the need for taxis.
    ◦ Transportation:
        ▪ Arrival in Jeddah (2021 Umrah): He landed at a newly opened airport in Jeddah where there were few taxis and a language barrier with drivers, causing initial challenges. However, he eventually managed to find a taxi.
        ▪ Local Commuting: For most local travel, especially from his hotel to the Haram, he walked due to the proximity. When taxis were needed, they were easily found on the street, and drivers understood destinations like "Harameen". He luckily met a Bangladeshi taxi driver who provided reliable service and picked him up from his hotel for the return journey to Jeddah Airport.
        ▪ Makkah to Madinah: He travelled by bus. He walked to a bus station (10-15 minutes from his hotel), purchased tickets, and boarded with his family. Upon arrival in Madinah, he took a taxi from the bus stand to his hotel.
• Site Seeing / Ziyarat:
    ◦ During his Hajj, he did not visit any historical or significant sites (Ziyarat) as it was a "shortest package" and these were not included.
    ◦ Similarly, during his Umrah trip (3 days in Makkah, 2 days in Madinah), he did not do Ziyarat. His primary focus was to spend maximum time in the Haram and Masjid Nabawi.
    ◦ The only instance he used Google Maps was to find the walking path from Masjid Nabawi to Quba Mosque.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Ritual Aids (Tawaf): Reza found it difficult to hold the phone and press a digital button to count circles during Tawaf. He suggested that automatic counting using GPS or similar technology would be very beneficial in the future. He also noted that the "Abort Tawaf" button on the app was enabled even before he started Tawaf, suggesting it should only activate once Tawaf begins.
• Transportation and Commuting:
    ◦ The primary challenge was commuting, especially during Hajj season, from the hotel to the Haram Sharif and back.
    ◦ Taxi Issues: Taxi drivers often demand excessive fares, requiring negotiation. They sometimes close roads or charge arbitrary prices when pilgrims are returning to their hotels, forcing people to walk further. The main problem with taxi drivers was the language barrier.
    ◦ Lack of Road Information: During Hajj season, the Saudi government frequently closes various routes, and this information is not readily available to pilgrims, which can disrupt plans for bus or taxi travel.
    ◦ Bus Ticket Issues: He faced issues buying bus tickets; sometimes he was told tickets weren't available, or ticket counters were closed, even though others managed to get tickets or ride without them.
• Lack of Centralised System: Reza highlighted a service gap in not having a centralised system to plan an entire trip, including hotel and taxi bookings for various places, in advance. He noted that while individual apps exist for these services, a single platform would be more convenient.
• Cost and Flexibility of Agencies: Reza indicated that agencies involve extra costs. For Umrah, he believes self-organising saves money and provides the flexibility to travel at one's own convenience, unlike agencies which have fixed schedules. While agencies handle management hassle, he feels it "depends" if the extra cost is justified, especially if one has time to plan independently.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Hajj App Enhancements:
    ◦ Comprehensive Duas: Include well-known duas from the Quran and Hadith, categorised for ease of access.
    ◦ Audio Support: Offer audio playback of duas for listening and recitation during Tawaf.
    ◦ Personalised Duas: Allow users to create playlists of their preferred duas.
    ◦ Accessibility Features: Provide support for different languages and, critically, the ability to change font size, which would greatly benefit users like him who have vision problems.
    ◦ Dua Guidance: A "Dua Companion" section with guidelines for successful duas, such as the importance of Ekhlas (sincerity) and facing the Qibla.
    ◦ Historical and Spiritual Context: Add historical information and stories about significant places (Ziyarat). Explain why specific Hajj and Umrah steps are performed, with references from Hadith, Quran, and history, to enrich understanding.
    ◦ Pilgrim Tips: Incorporate various useful tips for pilgrims.
    ◦ Post-Pilgrimage Engagement: Include features that help pilgrims maintain their spiritual commitment after Hajj/Umrah, such as weekly reminders for prayers, reciting specific surahs, or Tahajjud. It could also help pilgrims save money for future Umrah trips, making the app relevant long-term and preventing its deletion, helping to maintain their faith.
    ◦ Automatic Tawaf Counting: A future enhancement to count Tawaf circles automatically using GPS would be very valuable.
• Centralised Travel System: An app or system that can plan the entire trip, including hotel and taxi bookings for Ziyarat, from one place. This system could:
    ◦ Help manage fair taxi fares and prevent overcharging.
    ◦ Provide information on shuttle services or suggest hotels with shuttle arrangements/taxi contacts.
    ◦ Offer guidance on how to use local buses to the Haram.
    ◦ Crucially, provide real-time information on road closures and route changes during Hajj season to help pilgrims plan their transport effectively.
• Collaboration with Agencies: Develop features that benefit Hajj/Umrah agencies, encouraging them to recommend the app to their pilgrims, thereby generating income.
• Value-Added Features for Payment: Reza suggested that if the app included these unique and valuable features (especially historical context, spiritual reminders, and efficient travel management), he would be willing to pay an initial fee for it.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "If it could count the number of circle automatically using gps or something may not be possible now but may be in the future. During Tawaf it is difficult to hold the phone and press a digital button".
• "Specifically I like the four acts that were taught to in the session [Hajj preparation]: Adab, Sbor, Shukr, Istegfar. These four really helped me, during difficult situations in Hajj".
• "My Hajj was first time with Sheppard in 2025".
• "No, I went alone for Umrah".
• "The main problem with taxi drivers was the language".
• "The main thing is that this commuting from the hotel to Haram Sharif and getting a fair taxi fare was the big challenge".
• "If I go by myself then I don't have to bear that extra cost of the agency".
• "If the font size can be changed, it would be convenient for people like me".
• "So that we don't delete the app, it will feel like, 'No, I need to keep this app on my phone, it will help me maintain my faith'".
• "It makes me happy that you are doing something like this. I am also from this field, so if I can help in any way, it is a pleasure for me".
Other Observations
• Current App Value: Reza perceived that the app, in its current state, primarily provides information that is already available from various other sources (e.g., agency-provided books), and therefore, it doesn't add significant value that would warrant payment.
• Hajj vs. Umrah Travel Planning: He noted that agencies manage much of the Hajj logistics, but for Umrah, pilgrims often need to manage arrangements themselves or request specific services from agencies.
• Personal Preference for Umrah: Reza prefers to go individually for Umrah if possible, valuing the cost savings and flexibility over the convenience of an agency package. He acknowledges that for some, paying extra for agency management might be worthwhile if they are very busy.
• Tawaf Counting Methods: He observed that other pilgrims use physical counters, like a small tasbih-like device or a stopwatch, to count Tawaf circles.
• Expertise and Willingness to Help: Reza expressed enthusiasm for the app development, stating his professional background is in a similar field and he is happy to assist.

# 25. Samee Salehin Khan

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Pilgrim Background: Samee has performed Hajj twice, in 2024 and 2025. His first Hajj was with "Shepherd," and his second was with a different group. He clarifies that both trips were exclusively for the purpose of Hajj, not Umrah. Samee identifies himself as a "management person".
• Business Profile: Samee is a "Haj business entrepreneur" with an interest in the Hajj-Umrah sector. He is also an established garments entrepreneur.
• Years Active: His Hajj experiences are from 2024 and 2025. His current business venture in the Hajj-Umrah sector is recent, linked to a venture studio program.
Journey / Context
• Hajj Experiences:
    ◦ 2024 Hajj: Performed with "Shepherd". Samee stayed in hotels that he questioned whether they could be truly called "three-star".
    ◦ 2025 Hajj: Performed with another group. He stayed in hotels described as "one-star quality" but found them to offer significantly better service and space than the previous year, despite costing less (5.5 lakh BDT compared to 7 lakh BDT).
    ◦ Overall: Samee generally found both Hajj managements to be good and stated that he did not face major personal challenges, though he observed that some older pilgrims faced physical issues.
• Motivation for Starting a Business/Initial Setup: The source indicates Samee is a "Haj business entrepreneur" and his current venture in the Hajj-Umrah sector is "recent, linked to the venture studio program". Specific details on his deeper motivation or the initial setup process are not explicitly provided in the source.
Pain Points / Challenges
Samee experienced various challenges, both as a pilgrim and in his observations relevant to a Hajj business owner:
• As a Pilgrim:
    ◦ Communication & Notifications: Samee found the constant communication via WhatsApp from agencies "noisy" and "distracting". He felt compelled to constantly check messages, which interfered with his concentration on Hajj rituals. He considered notifications about non-essential things (like ice cream availability) particularly unnecessary and attention-demanding. He preferred the approach of his second Hajj group, which provided updates for the next three days' activities, rather than continuous real-time messages.
    ◦ Transportation (outside agency arrangements):
        ▪ Language Barrier: Communicating with local drivers was difficult due to the language barrier, as English was not widely understood, and Arabic was necessary.
        ▪ Taxi Scams: He encountered significant issues with Asian drivers (especially Pakistani drivers) who would overcharge ("five or six times more fare") and behave rudely, which he described as "robbery" and "injustice". Arab drivers were comparatively better and less unjust, with some in Madinah even offering rides without charge.
        ▪ Uber: While generally safer, Asian drivers using Uber might still try to find excuses to manipulate fares. Samee advised pilgrims to be knowledgeable and assertive when dealing with drivers.
    ◦ Hotel & Food: While generally satisfied, he noted a difference in hotel quality versus price, observing that higher cost did not always guarantee better service. He also noted that his first Hajj (more expensive) provided additional food during core Hajj rituals, while the second (cheaper) provided consistent food throughout but no extra provisions.
    ◦ Guidance during Ziyarah: His first Hajj agency (Shepherd) charged extra for Ziyarah but offered longer durations and better explanations. The second group offered free Ziyarah but with shorter durations and less detailed explanations. He also noted challenges with real-time audio guidance on buses, suggesting pre-recorded audio as better.
    ◦ Maintaining Concentration: Samee found it challenging to maintain focus on prayers and Duas during Hajj, especially when trying to follow written supplications. He observed a significant difference in the style and perceived sincerity of Dua between Arabs and non-Arabs. He also felt that for "full concentration," printed materials were "a bit better" than a mobile phone due to potential distractions.
• As a Business Owner (Implicit from his interest areas):
    ◦ Understanding Pilgrim Diversity: Recognizing that pilgrims have diverse needs and priorities (e.g., some focus on comfort, others on spiritual concentration).
    ◦ Balancing Cost & Service: The challenge of providing good service while keeping costs down to cater to pilgrims with limited budgets.
Opportunities / Suggestions
Samee offered several suggestions for improving the pilgrim experience and Hajj-Umrah services:
• Service Innovations:
    ◦ Predictive Information Delivery: Agencies should provide projected schedules (e.g., for the next three days) rather than overwhelming pilgrims with frequent, non-urgent real-time notifications, with only critical updates being real-time.
    ◦ Hotel Proximity: For future Hajj trips, Samee intends to stay as close as possible to the Haram, balancing this with financial capability, as it allows for easier access for daily prayers and short breaks.
    ◦ Spiritual Engagement during Hajj: Services should focus on maximizing a pilgrim's time for worship and connection with Allah, rather than distracting them with unnecessary updates.
• Operational Improvements:
    ◦ Technology for Training: Technology (like Zoom, Google Meet, or custom platforms) can play a good role in training pilgrims, especially for those unable to attend physical sessions due to location or other constraints.
    ◦ Audio Guides for Ziyarah: Using audio recordings or personal devices (like earpieces) for guides to communicate in noisy Ziyarah environments is highly recommended. This allows for clear explanations without disturbing others or encountering issues with authorities.
    ◦ Digital Frameworks for Hajj Journey: Apps can provide a digital "framework" or "chart" for pilgrims, including countdowns, checklists of activities, and reminders, to help them track their spiritual progress without being overly distracting.
    ◦ Post-Hajj Spiritual Support: A post-Hajj program (e.g., a one-year boot camp with monthly/bimonthly check-ins) can help pilgrims maintain the spiritual essence and habits cultivated during Hajj.
• Marketing Tactics:
    ◦ Value-for-Money Packages: Highlighting that good service can be provided at a lower cost, as experienced by Samee himself.
• Technology & AI Integration:
    ◦ Weather/Temperature Guidance: AI can help pilgrims by providing information on weather and temperature.
    ◦ Language Barrier Solutions: While current tools have limitations, technology could be further developed to overcome language barriers more effectively.
    ◦ Offline Guide Apps: Mobile apps can serve as a valuable alternative to printed guidebooks, providing spiritual guidance, logistical information (hotels, locations), and descriptions of historical/religious sites.
    ◦ AI-Powered Dua Crafting Tool: An AI tool that can take a pilgrim's personal Dua list and augment it by adding praises to Allah, salutations to the Prophet (PBUH), relevant Quranic verses/Hadith, and incorporating Duas for the wider Muslim Ummah could significantly enhance the spiritual experience.
    ◦ Financial Planning App (SIP Model): An app incorporating a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) model could help individuals save small amounts regularly to plan and afford their Hajj/Umrah journey. Samee believes it is possible to design low-risk investment portfolios for this purpose.

Other Observations
• Customer Behaviour Insights:
    ◦ Pilgrims have varying priorities: some prioritise comfort (food, hotel), while others are more focused on spiritual concentration.
    ◦ There is a segment of pilgrims who may prefer to undertake Umrah independently or in self-organized groups rather than relying on agencies.
    ◦ Pilgrims may find it challenging to maintain focus during spiritual acts like Dua, even with aids like written notes.
• Lessons Learned:
    ◦ Effective communication is crucial, but over-communication can be detrimental to a pilgrim's spiritual focus.
    ◦ Higher prices do not always guarantee better service or comfort; value for money is a key consideration.
    ◦ Technology can significantly enhance the Hajj experience, both logistically and spiritually, but it should be designed to support concentration rather than cause distraction.
    ◦ There is a clear opportunity to develop tools that empower pilgrims, from financial planning to spiritual guidance and prayer assistance.

# 26. Shamima Ara Leera

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information – Pilgrim Shamima Ara Leera
• Name: Shamima Ara Leera.
• Profession: Former engineer in the telecom industry; currently not working.
• Pilgrimage Type(s) & Year(s):
    ◦ First Hajj: 2014.
    ◦ Second Hajj: 2022.
• Personal/Family Context:
    ◦ Her parents prayed and fasted, but she states her family did not belong to a "practicing Muslim family in that way" as her father was a university professor.
    ◦ She was accustomed to a corporate culture before Hajj.
    ◦ Hajj was a "big turning point in my life". Within one month of returning from her first Hajj, she was able to read Bukhari Sharif (translation) and the Tafsir of the Quran, calling this a "huge turning point for my life".
    ◦ Her transformation included adopting "complete hijab" during Hajj preparation, an understanding of which she gained then.
Journey / Context – Accommodation, Facilities, Guidance Experience
• Hajj Preparation:
    ◦ Her first Hajj journey in 2014 was of "short duration," and she "didn't really have the preparation".
    ◦ She attended a short-duration class (two to three weeks) for preparation, held in a home-based setup where family women shared experiences.
    ◦ She learned many things primarily after arriving in Hajj, especially through interactions with pilgrims from other countries like Malaysian, Arab, and Pakistani women.
• Logistical Management:
    ◦ Handling luggage, plane tickets, and cars was a "mixed" responsibility.
    ◦ In 2014, pilgrims had to handle their own luggage, but by 2022, logistics had "improved a lot".
• Dua Management during Rituals:
    ◦ She used traditional methods: memorising duas, using personalised checklists, booklets provided by agencies, or self-prepared notes from books.
    ◦ She found it difficult to read from a mobile phone during Tawaf and Sa'i due to crowds.
• Learning Experience in Holy Cities:
    ◦ Medina was a "big learning experience," including sessions for women after Asr prayer on how to pray and bring concentration.
Pain Points / Challenges – Safety, Hygiene, Privacy, Comfort
• Guidance Gaps for Women:
    ◦ Most Hajj instructors are men, which she felt created an obstacle for women in asking questions and learning, particularly concerning how women should behave with one another and the specific problems women face during Hajj.
    ◦ There is a "lacking among our women" regarding manners, or 'adab', especially for Mecca and Medina.
    ◦ There is a general lack of "Islamic or spiritual knowledge" compared to bookish knowledge among Bangladeshi women.
• Behavioural/Emotional Challenges:
    ◦ She observes that "we women tend to be a bit more impatient and easily get frustrated", whereas Hajj is "a huge test of patience". She notes that "many of us women do not know" how to maintain patience, or haven't been "culturally educated" in this way.
    ◦ She found that in general, people "like to read less" and perceive quizzes as "kind of like an exam," leading to an avoidance of such learning tools.
• Logistical Hurdles:
    ◦ For less educated women or those unable to operate smartphones, logistical matters like getting lost or not recognising places are a significant "hassle".
    ◦ Pilgrims face major problems with "police often block roads," "diversions," and extreme crowds during Hajj. She recalled an incident during her first Hajj where a pilgrim became very ill due to the conditions.
    ◦ Lack of awareness about physical preparation for Hajj (e.g., walking habits) leads to difficulties for many pilgrims who find they "can't do it there".
    ◦ Difficulty navigating locations, including knowing where gates, communication points, toilets, lost and found, and emergency spots are, and how to interact in these situations.
• Privacy Concerns (Location Sharing):
    ◦ She acknowledged that sharing live location involves "sacrificing some of their privacy".
• Maintaining Spiritual Spirit Post-Hajj:
    ◦ She commented that "we tend to get lost" after Hajj, implying a struggle to maintain the spiritual transformation and practices experienced during the pilgrimage.
Opportunities / Suggestions – Women-focused Guidance, Improved Facilities, Safer Travel
• Improved Guidance & Education:
    ◦ Hajj instructors should "try to cover the issues concerning women more".
    ◦ More priority should be given to teaching "adab" (manners) and proper interaction with others, instilling these values in pilgrims' hearts.
    ◦ Recorded and on-demand lectures would "definitely add value" for Hajj preparation, allowing learning at convenience and covering approximately 90% of content. However, in-person interaction is still needed for the remaining 10% and experiential matters.
    ◦ Scenario-based quizzes on topics like patience and rituals would "definitely add value" and help "reinforce learning," although she suggests they should be optional due to general aversion to quizzes.
• Technology Solutions for Rituals and Prayers:
    ◦ A mobile app with duas in an "organised checklist format" would be "definitely beneficial" for review, memorisation, and easy finding, despite challenges of using a mobile in crowded areas during Tawaf/Sa'i.
    ◦ She believes a smartwatch device for Tawaf count and playing duas via Bluetooth headphones (with text display) would likely not be very popular as people generally prefer "as few devices as possible" and want a single mobile phone for "maximum tasks".
• Enhanced Navigation & Information:
    ◦ An interactive map within an app showing Sunnah and rituals for Mina, Arafah, and Muzdalifah, including significant places (e.g., mosques, Prophet's (PBUH) significant locations), would "definitely benefit" pilgrims.
    ◦ This app could also allow pilgrims to add their own duas.
    ◦ The app should include an "introductory aspect" with a "path idea" and visible information on Mecca's gates, communication points, toilet locations, lost and found, and emergency interaction protocols.
    ◦ Location-based awareness for sightseeing and exploration (e.g., in Aziziah) would be "very good" to help pilgrims know what's around them and avoid wasting time.
• Safety and Communication Innovations:
    ◦ A Hajj-specific social networking stream that allows pilgrims to connect location-wise with those around them, message nearby users, and receive SOS notifications if a pilgrim is unwell would be "beneficial".
    ◦ Pilgrims should be able to share their live location with their agency and family members.
    ◦ She suggested promoting location sharing mainly during important Hajj days or high traffic/crowd times, not constantly.
    ◦ An emergency contact feature could include a button for "speed dial" or pre-entered numbers to send messages with location or SOS alerts.
• Post-Hajj Spiritual Reinforcement:
    ◦ A Hajj-specific social network to connect pilgrims after Hajj for "regular reminders, memory sharing, and maintaining the spirit" would be "beneficial," and "one must try" to implement it despite potential challenges.
• App Monetisation Model:
    ◦ Such an app would "add value".
    ◦ She suggested a business model of "one month free or some beta version," followed by a one-time payment for a year.
    ◦ She would be willing to pay up to 500 Taka for a one-year subscription.
Quotes & Memorable Statements – Verbatim
• "But this Hajj experience was actually a big turning point in my life".
• "And after returning from Hajj, honestly, I had never read Hadiths in my life. That was a big thing for me that within one month of returning from Hajj, Alhamdulillah, I was able to read Bukhari Sharif... Plus, reading the Tafsir of the Quran. That also came from there for me, and as I said, it was a huge turning point for my life".
• "But actually, the main thing I feel in the context of our country, what is lacking among our women, I think, regarding Hajj, is manners, or 'adab'. By 'adab', I mean there is a certain mannerism for Mecca and Medina. Plus, we are culturally quite behind... not Islamic or spiritual knowledge, which is a bit less among us".
• "But Hajj is really a matter of patience, a huge test of patience".
• "Because we actually like to read less. And the matter of exams, I mean, a quiz feels kind of like an exam. So, for this reason, we tend to avoid it again...".
• "I mean, it's not like 100% of everything happens only through recorded aspects. That's not right... we can cover about 90% perhaps, and for the remaining 10%, if there's any interaction, that would be good".
• "The main thing for me is that in 2014 Hajj, I saw many pilgrims around me whose piety amazed me greatly. Plus, their dedication... praying for one another, wishing well for one another – these things, we didn't really grow up in that environment... Plus, sharing, the matter of sharing... I never thought that people could share things with each other like this, which we rarely see among people around us".
• "...corporáte culture means... everything is like corporate politics, meaning blaming one's fault on another. So, the fact that this is not right, I wouldn't have felt that if I hadn't gone for Hajj... But that this is a great sin, that it should not be done, I understood that there...".
• "It is said, is it not, that you must try to stay with good people, you must try to mingle with righteous servants. Now, if you don't try, it won't happen. So, it's our responsibility. Whether it's beneficial for someone or not, I think one should try. Perhaps out of ten, one or two, whatever it is, even from that, a change will come. Change is needed".
Other Observations – Gender-related Cultural Notes
• Shamima Ara Leera explicitly mentions that female pilgrims in Bangladesh lack 'adab' (manners) and spiritual knowledge, being more focused on "bookish knowledge". She attributes this partly to their cultural upbringing.
• She points out that women tend to be "more impatient and easily get frustrated," which is a significant challenge given Hajj's demand for patience.
• She observed that "our culture of practicing Muslims is very less" and that "we actually do everything just for show, it seems".
• She contrasts the spiritual depth of women from other countries (Malaysian, Arab, Pakistani, Iranian, Indonesian) who "love the Quran immensely" and "practice it in their conduct," noting this is "less common among us" (Bangladeshis).
• She laments the lack of a "mentality of helping people" among her own people, considering it "unfortunate" and linking it to their "education system, our culture, some aspects are religious".
• Her personal transformation after Hajj included adopting complete hijab and deepening her study of Hadith and Quran Tafsir, suggesting this is a key takeaway from her pilgrimage.
• She generally believes people prefer minimal devices, favouring a single mobile phone for "maximum tasks" over additional gadgets like smartwatches for specific functions.
• She notes that people often "tend to get lost" in their spiritual journey and practices once they return home from Hajj.

# 27. Solaiman Transport Owner

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Years in service: Solaimin has been in the driving profession in Makkah and Madinah for a "long time".
• Vehicle types: He owns a transport business and has "three cars registered with Nusuk". He has cars available in both Makkah and Madinah.
• Service area: Solaimin provides transport services in Makkah and Madinah. His services cover routes "right from Jeddah Airport to Makkah, Makkah Ziyarah, Taif, then Madinah, and for those going to Madinah Airport". He confirms he is "everywhere" and has cars on "both sides" (Makkah and Madinah).
Journey / Context
• Client types: He primarily serves Hajj pilgrims ("Hajjis"). He also works extensively with agencies, collaborating with "almost 40 agencies". He serves pilgrims from "all countries", including Indonesians.
• Busiest seasons: While specific seasons are not mentioned as "busiest", the interview implies a consistent demand for transport services from pilgrims. For instance, for the current month, he has "113 bookings", with each booking potentially comprising "eight to ten family members".
• Trip patterns: Typical trips include transporting pilgrims "from Jeddah Airport to Makkah, Makkah Ziyarah, Taif, then Madinah, and for those going to Madinah Airport". He also handles trips from "Makkah to Madinah, and then after doing the Ziyarah, bringing the pilgrims from the airport". He has completed three Nusuk-registered trips in a single day from Madinah Airport.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Traffic and Crowding: A common issue pilgrims face is that "a 10-minute journey can take half an hour there", implying significant traffic or congestion. He advises pilgrims to "be calm" and "patient" in this environment.
• Communication with Pilgrims: A major challenge is "the language" barrier, especially with non-Bengali speakers like Pakistanis. He states, "If one can make them understand, then there would be no problem, but if they cannot be made to understand, then there is a problem".
• Fare Understanding: Pilgrims often "don't understand the fare" after taking a car.
• Lack of App-Based Services in Makkah: Unlike Madinah where Uber is popular, Makkah "doesn't have this facility" for pilgrims to book transport via mobile apps.
• Complex Business Models: Solaimin expresses that certain "step-by-step processes" or platform models requiring extensive English knowledge are "a bit tough" for him.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Direct Service Provision: Solaimin directly offers his transport services to pilgrims and agencies in Makkah and Madinah.
• Guide Services: He can provide guides ("Hujurs") who are university students or scholars. This addresses the pilgrim complaint that "there are no guides" and they "don't understand where to go or what to do".
• Multilingual Drivers: To overcome language barriers, Solaiman employs drivers who can speak English, Arabic, and Bengali. He specifically mentions having "three people whom I keep for English" to cater to various language needs, stating that "otherwise, you can't do business".
• Flexible Payment: He is flexible with payment, accepting advance payments or cash after the trip is completed, stating that pilgrims who come for Hajj "haven't come to steal my money. He will pay the money".
• Documentation: He is willing to provide all necessary documents to pilgrims if requested, including his "license, Iqama, [and] car documents".
• Business Partnership Models:
    ◦ He prefers a direct profit-sharing model where partners take their profit and he takes his.
    ◦ He is willing to offer discounts to pilgrims referred by partners.
    ◦ He proposes a "referral fee" for new business, offering "20% from 100 taka" if pilgrims are provided to him.
• Nusuk Integration: Solaimin's cars are registered with Nusuk, allowing him to take bookings through the Nusuk system.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "Brother, I have a transport business, Inshallah, if they take my transport in Makkah and Madinah, I will provide it, Inshallah."
• "When people go to another country, they need to be calm. If they're not calm, it won't work. They need to be patient."
• "The problem is with the language. If one can make them understand, then there would be no problem, but if they cannot be made to understand, then there is a problem."
• "Since he has come for Hajj, he hasn't come to steal my money. He will pay the money."
• "You understand, you have to keep people everywhere. Otherwise, you can't do business."
• "For me, look, getting 40% to 50% from one person's work is enough. No need to take more than that."
• "Of course, I will give a discount, and if you say how much you will take from 100 taka, you will get 20% from 100 taka if you give us pilgrims."
• "Alhamdulillah, your service is very good. That's why I'm talking to you. I myself went with you. I went to Taif, Alhamdulillah. Then I went for Makkah Ziyarah." (Muhammad's assessment of Solaiman's service)
Other Observations
• Client Behavioural Patterns: Pilgrims often face difficulties getting cars and understanding fares. They may lack patience and require guidance on their pilgrimage journey. While word-of-mouth referrals are common ("When the service is good, our transfers/transport are taken"), some pilgrims may also request official documentation from drivers.
• Operational Risks: The primary operational risk highlighted is the language barrier with non-Bengali speaking pilgrims, which can lead to communication difficulties and issues in service provision. Traffic congestion is also a significant factor affecting travel times.
• Agency Profit Margins: Solaimin notes that agencies "make a lot of profit" from pilgrims. He suggests a 40-50% profit for a referrer is "enough" and advises against excessive profit-taking.
• Trust-Based Business: Solaiman operates on a high degree of trust, particularly regarding payment from pilgrims. He also values existing trust relationships, such as the one established through Saleh Bhai.
• Service Quality & Referrals: Good service leads to referrals and continued business, as evidenced by Muhammad's positive experience with Solaiman's service.

# 28. Tahmeed Sharif

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Trip Type(s) & Year: Tahmeed Sharif performed Hajj in 2024. He also mentions the possibility of performing Umrah independently in the future.
• Travel Style: His Hajj journey lasted 40 days. He chose his Hajj agency based on a referral from a brother's Facebook post and the brother's shared experience. A main criterion for choosing the agency was that they perform everything according to authentic Sunnah and have a good guide, specifically mentioning a Sheikh Doctor. He emphasises the importance of being able to perform Hajj under a good scholar.
• Age Group: While not explicitly stated, Tahmeed Sharif is currently the founder of a company (Brown Dike) and a software engineer. His professional background, particularly in learning management solutions, and his engagement with digital solutions suggest he likely belongs to a younger adult or young professional age group.
Journey / Context
• Planning Process:
    ◦ He registered with the agency after a referral and a brother shared his experience.
    ◦ He also gathered information about the agency from many other people.
    ◦ For preparation, the agency conducted live classes online, which Tahmeed participated in.
• Budget Constraints: Cost was not a primary factor in choosing the agency initially, but it became a consideration for other services. For instance, he expressed that he would not personally pay for educational content apps because Hajj is often a once-in-a-lifetime journey, and pilgrims are already spending a lot of money. He suggested partnerships with agencies for such services.
• Travel Companions: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts, but the context of an agency-led Hajj implies travel within a group.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Document Submission: Initially, it was challenging to submit documents, especially during Ramadan. He later learned that the agency had partners in Chittagong ([Gojiyara - inaudible/best guess: Goziara]) who could have received the documents, but this information was provided late. He found going to Dhaka during Ramadan to submit documents "a bit challenging".
• Lack of Localised Events: He suggested that the agency could have organised "at least some get-togethers or events in Chittagong" for pilgrims from that region, noting they are now doing so from this year.
• Effectiveness of Classes: While classes were effective, he felt they "could have been a bit more interactive".
• SIM Card and Connectivity:
    ◦ A significant challenge was where to buy a SIM card upon arrival. His phone supported only e-SIMs, and staff couldn't immediately provide instructions.
    ◦ Recharging the SIM was also difficult, especially when he was in Aziziyah where direct recharge options were limited, forcing him to use more expensive online payment methods.
    ◦ He highlighted the initial "tension" of not being able to communicate if a SIM wasn't immediately available.
• Language Barrier: He noted a significant language barrier in Saudi Arabia, with many staff or management not speaking English well.
• Reliance on Physical Books: He had to carry a book for duas and Sunnahs during Umrah.
• Logistics on Hajj Days (Movement & Transport): He stated that movement by car and getting to places was "very difficult" during Hajj days. Problems included difficulty getting buses, cars being unavailable, and "very expensive" taxi prices, where a 10 Riyal fare could become 300-400 Riyals. He identified this as a "big challenge for pilgrims".
• Information Accessibility (Physical Classes, Locations): He initially didn't know about the availability of physical classes in different languages during Hajj and only found out later. He also pointed out the lack of crucial information on locations, their significance, and live events (e.g., library in Makkah, Zamzam location, Masjid Nabawi activities, Ziyarat places like Taif, Masjid Abbas, Masjid Quba).
• Crowdsourced Information Effectiveness: He believes crowdsourced information for transport issues would not be "very effective" if it's purely peer-to-peer. He advocates for government enforcement and centralised systems for fare monitoring and instructions.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Enhanced Learning Experience:
    ◦ More interactive and digital learning: Tahmeed suggested making the learning journey more interactive and effective through digital means.
    ◦ Centralised Pilgrim Dashboards: A system where data is available on a government dashboard and agency dashboard could extend to pilgrims, offering related resources, course options, and mandatory prerequisites.
    ◦ Quizzes and MCQs: Incorporating question-answer and MCQ formats could help pilgrims be "better prepared".
    ◦ Duolingo Model: He agreed that following a Duolingo-like model with "bite-sized content," quizzes, and interactive games would be beneficial due to people's short attention spans. This would make learning easier and more memorable.
    ◦ Pre-learned Arabic Phrases: Learning some Arabic phrases beforehand would make navigating easier due to the language barrier.
    ◦ Mobile App for Duas: He believes a mobile app with all duas and Sunnahs would be very convenient, potentially similar to features in the Nusuk app.
    ◦ Post-Hajj Learning Platform: A learning platform for pilgrims during their long stay (e.g., 15-40 days) to utilise their time effectively, such as taking Quran classes, was suggested and deemed beneficial.
    ◦ Information on Physical Classes: The app could inform pilgrims about available physical classes and where to register, especially for Bangladeshis, allowing them to interact more with locals and scholars.
• Improved Communication and Navigation:
    ◦ AI Agent / Live Translator: Both Tahmeed and Muhammad discussed the potential of AI agents acting as live translators for conversations, which Tahmeed believed would "make the Hajj experience much easier".
    ◦ Pre-arranged SIM or Digital Guidance: An app allowing pilgrims to buy a SIM connection for the first few days or providing guidance on where to buy SIMs and available packages (e.g., from local operators like Grameenphone or Robi for roaming) would prevent communication breakdown and initial worry.
    ◦ Interactive Maps and Location Significance: An app featuring interactive maps showing significant locations (e.g., in Makkah, Madinah, Ziyarat places), their stories, and historical or Quran/Sunnah significance, along with live event information, would be "very valuable".
• Logistical Support:
    ◦ Crowdsourcing App for Movement/Traffic: While initially hesitant about peer-to-peer communication for transport fares, Tahmeed agreed that a crowdsourcing app for traffic alerts, road closures, and movement updates would be "very useful" for helping pilgrims navigate unexpected situations.
    ◦ Government-Controlled Transport Information: He stressed that transport information and price enforcement would be "more effective" if controlled and enforced by the government, rather than relying solely on crowd-sourced information.
    ◦ Information on Shopping and Food: An app providing information on good markets, food courts, and attractions for shopping and food would be beneficial.
• Post-Hajj Engagement: A Hajj-focused mini social networking app to help pilgrims stay connected with those they performed Hajj with, share memories, and maintain the spirit of Hajj was suggested, and Tahmeed found it potentially beneficial.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "Mainly, one criterion was that they perform everything according to authentic Sunnah and have a good guide".
• "going to Dhaka during Ramadan to submit the documents was a bit challenging for me".
• "Yes, the classes were effective, but I think they could have been a bit more interactive".
• "Yes, I think this would be beneficial because currently, people's attention spans are very short. So, if large courses of two, three, or four hours are given, it might be difficult for many to follow. So, small, interactive courses would be easier and would stick in their minds better".
• "Yes, this is definitely a very good idea. This will make the Hajj experience much easier for people, Insha'Allah, if it can be implemented" (referring to AI translator).
• "There's a challenge regarding buying a SIM card, where to buy it from".
• "Mainly, the guidelines, meaning where I can get it from, or at least initially, I don't have to worry that I won't be able to communicate, or that I couldn't get a SIM, if that could be arranged".
• "My point was that if it's done by people, I personally don't think it would be very effective. If it's enforced by the government... then it would be more effective. More so than if people say it" (regarding crowdsourced transport information).
• "Yes, brother, in this case, a crowd-sourcing app could be very useful" (regarding traffic alerts and road closures).
• "Brother, I personally would not pay, because normally people don't always go [to Hajj]. Since it's almost a once-in-a-lifetime journey for most people, I don't think paying for this would be very pocket-friendly. And people are already spending so much money for Hajj".
Other Observations
• Energy Levels: Tahmeed Sharif provides detailed and thoughtful answers throughout the interview, demonstrating an engaged and consistent energy level. He actively participates in problem-solving and ideation.
• Adaptability & Tech-Savviness: As a software engineer and founder, he readily discusses digital solutions and their potential application to Hajj experiences. His suggestions for digital dashboards, bite-sized learning, AI translators, and crowd-sourcing apps highlight his comfort with and understanding of technology to overcome challenges.
• Peer Influence: His initial agency choice was based on a referral and shared experience from a peer. While he expressed skepticism about purely peer-to-peer communication for transport fares during Hajj, he acknowledged the value of peers helping each other with information and the potential for a Hajj-focused social network. He also notes that people help each other by sharing information during Hajj challenges.
• Pragmatism: Despite suggesting numerous digital solutions, he remains pragmatic about their implementation, particularly regarding payment for educational content and the role of government enforcement for critical logistics like transport pricing.
• Future Intent: He expresses a clear intent to perform Umrah independently in the future, if possible, indicating a desire for self-reliance and potentially more flexible travel options beyond agency packages.

    ◦ Hajj Trips: Work in partnership with "Shepherds" (partners). Prices for Hajj packages typically vary from 600,000 Taka up to 1,200,000 Taka.
Journey / Context
• Group Sizes:
    ◦ Customised Packages: Predominantly star packages, making up roughly 80% of their total Umrah travellers, assuming a total of 100 travellers per year during the initial phase of the business. These can accommodate varied group sizes (two, four, six, eight, ten people).
    ◦ Economy Packages: Very few compared to customised star packages.
• Partnerships: The agency collaborates with Wayes Kuruni Azad's younger brother, who runs a separate agency. They send both customised and economy packages together through his agency. This collaboration helps provide better reviews and competitive rates because his brother can directly purchase hotels and they have a shared login site to buy hotels without third-party involvement. The partner frequently travels to Makkah and Madinah, ensuring better service delivery, while Wayes Kuruni Azad travels less due to family issues.
• Hotel Sourcing: Hotels are sourced from agents who deal with multiple hotels (e.g., "MR Group" agents or sub-agents covering 15 hotels in Makkah-Madinah), considered "first-hand" or "second-hand" (owner then hotel agent) sources, not directly from hotels. Direct purchasing from hotels is generally not possible. This strong network was built through the partner's prior experience working with an agency that dealt with these hotels, establishing personal relationships and authenticity.
• Service Provision & Management:
    ◦ Customer Communication: Emphasises proper and timely communication with customers and understanding their "pulse". This includes setting expectations for economy packages (e.g., no water, bring own plates).
    ◦ Problem Resolution: Immediate response to customer issues, focusing on showing sympathy and empathy.
    ◦ Additional Services: For customised packages, paid "add-on" services are offered, such as:
        ▪ Meet-and-assist service (200 Saudi Riyals in Makkah, 200 in Madinah).
        ▪ Guidance/Imam (Alem) (200 Saudi Riyals).
        ▪ Ziyarah guide (200 Saudi Riyals). These are kept separate from basic package prices to maintain competitiveness and allow customers to choose. The agency might have a small margin (e.g., 50 Riyals on meet-and-assist if cost is 150 Riyals for a 200 Riyal charge), but often provides these as compliments, as profit is not the main goal here.
• Seasonal Patterns: Ramadan and December are the busiest months. During these periods, services become challenging due to crowding, increased prices, and disruption/unavailability of hotel and transport services. The agency proactively trains and prepares customers for these challenges beforehand. Hotel rates also fluctuate, with prices being higher and less available closer to busy seasons.
Pain Points / Challenges
1. Financial Constraints & Margins:
    ◦ Low Margins: Especially for economy packages, after deducting flight, visa, and transport costs, very little is left for hotel costs, resulting in very low margins (3,000-6,000 Taka per 150,000 Taka package, or ~5,000 Taka per lakh). Premium packages offer better margins (10,000-15,000 Taka per package) but still only 5-6% of the 200,000-250,000 Taka price range.
    ◦ High Airline Prices: Airlines, possibly due to a "syndicate" or AI system, now set high ticket prices (90,000-100,000 Taka even for tickets booked 1.5 months in advance), which impacts package pricing.
    ◦ Increasing Hotel Costs: Hotel demolitions and closures due to non-compliance in Makkah-Madinah lead to rising hotel prices annually. New Saudi regulations (e.g., app-based confirmations) also increase business, operational, and logistics costs, pushing up package prices.
2. Person-Dependency: The business is highly dependent on the personal involvement of the owner or partner. Customers prefer the owner's presence, but constant travel to Saudi Arabia prevents handling sales, marketing, and overall operations in Bangladesh. Building independent links for hotel sourcing is an ongoing challenge, currently relying on the partner's pre-existing connections.
3. Customer Expectations vs. Reality:
    ◦ High Expectations: Customers, even those opting for economy packages, have very high expectations due to the spiritual significance and financial investment.
    ◦ Saudi Service Quality: Saudi hotels and local behaviour (e.g., in lifts) often fall short of international or even Bangladeshi service standards, leading to customer dissatisfaction. Pilgrims expect religious reverence and sacrificial behaviour, not commercial demand-supply dynamics, which leads to surprise and complaints when they encounter such issues. There is also a perceived "racism factor" in how Bengalis are treated in Saudi Arabia.
    ◦ Agency Promise Keeping: A major customer complaint is that "most agencies don't keep their promises".
4. Operational Scalability: The business is currently in an "investment" or "take-off" stage, focusing on service over immediate high profit. Scaling requires increasing pilgrim volume while simultaneously expanding the operational team to manage costs, which is challenging. Without strong "backward linkage" (operations), aggressive advertising can lead to an inability to accommodate customers and negative future impact.
5. Regulatory Compliance & Sourcing Complexity:
    ◦ Saudi Licensing: A Hajj license from Bangladesh Ministry is a prerequisite for direct contracts with Saudi agencies for hotel and service sourcing.
    ◦ Nusuk Platform Limitations: The Nusuk platform itself is reliant on Saudi agents, and direct B2B buying is not straightforward. Visa companies often require pilgrims to use their authorised transport services, with risks of fines if non-compliant.
    ◦ Network Building: Establishing the strong networks required for competitive hotel sourcing is challenging for new entrants, as it relies heavily on personal relations and trust to avoid risks like agents absconding with money.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Volume-Based Growth: The business model is volume-dependent; even with lower margins, increased volume leads to profitability.
• Customer Investment & Referrals: Instead of high advertising costs, investing more in customer service (e.g., small corrections, incentives) generates better reviews and leads to significant referrals, which is crucial as the Hajj/Umrah business is highly referral-based. Premium customers have higher lifetime value and conversion potential to Hajj packages.
• Digital Tool Adoption:
    ◦ CRM/SaaS Software: Would be interested in free CRM/SaaS software for customer management (tracking recurring customers, referrals, interactions) if it's cost-effective and easy to switch from Excel. Adoption timing depends on business growth and volume.
    ◦ Mobile Apps for Pilgrims: An app offering ritual guidance, integrated training modules, and logistical information (guide names, hotel, itinerary, documents) would be valuable, reducing the need for continuous monitoring by the agency.
        ▪ Adoption Strategy: Agencies would need to be proactive in popularising the app through marketing and campaigns, possibly offering incentives (e.g., 1,000 Taka discount) to encourage initial adoption.
        ▪ Agency Motivation: For agencies to promote such an app (especially with discounts), it needs to be shown that it will positively impact future business, branding, and long-term value creation for the agency. A win-win scenario, like a heavily discounted subscription for pilgrims (e.g., 200 Taka for a 1,000 Taka app), could be appealing.
• B2B Collaborations: Open to B2B collaborations with online platforms (like Agoda/Booking.com for Hajj/Umrah) that can offer discounted rates and marketing help, driving volume even if margins are slightly lower. A "pay-as-you-go" model is currently more viable than a flat-fee membership model, especially without confirmed sales.

• "The current model is profit-based. It's not salary-based yet".
• "Without a license, no one will want to make an agreement with you, brother. If you don't have a Hajj license, then it's tough for you to directly contact that Saudi agency. So, you could say it's a prerequisite that you must have a license".

• "Saudi people are like this, Saudi people treat Bengalis like this.".
Other Observations
• Business Philosophy: The agency is currently focused on service quality and building goodwill rather than high profit margins, especially in its initial phase. They aim for a "standard price" competitive with the market while investing more in customer experience.
• Hotel Sourcing Nuances: Direct hotel purchases are not the norm; rather, it involves negotiating with specific agents who have direct or near-direct access to hotel allocations. These relationships are critical for competitive rates and reliability. The agency currently relies on the partner's pre-existing strong personal relationships and authenticity with these hotel agents, and Wayes Kuruni Azad himself does not have direct access yet.
• Service Provider Reliability: Current service providers (drivers, guides) are reliable, with relationships built through continued work.
• Digital Tooling Usage: Currently, the agency primarily uses Facebook, WhatsApp, and a basic website for digital operations and marketing.
• Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): While not precisely calculated, current CAC is estimated to be around 1,000-2,000 Taka per customer due to minimal large-scale advertising. If fully valuated with a high-salaried executive, the CAC would be significantly higher, and the business would only be at break-even or slightly above. The business model is currently profit-based, not salary-based for the owner.
• Pilgrim Behaviour: Pilgrims' perception of the one-time nature of Hajj/Umrah trips makes them hesitant to adopt new apps that require a learning curve, as they might feel it's not a long-term utility.

# 30. Zohorah Khanam

## # Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Pilgrimage Type(s): Zohora Khanam performed Hajj in 2024 and had the opportunity to perform Umrah multiple times during her stay, including one upon arrival from Bangladesh and another after visiting Taif.
• Year(s): She performed Hajj in 2024. Her intention to perform Hajj had been present since around 2015.
• Group Composition: Zohora performed Hajj with her brother and sister-in-law. Her immediate travelling group also included an elderly aunt, and the group comprised three females. Previous family members, including her sister and other relatives, had performed Hajj earlier, some with the same agency, Shepherd.
• Agency Choice: Zohora chose the "Shepherd" agency due to positive referrals from her family members who had previously travelled with them in 2022. Their proven satisfactory performance and commitment to service delivery instilled trust. She also compared Shepherd with two or three other agencies, considering their services and budget, but Shepherd was ultimately deemed the most suitable.
Journey / Context
• Travel Companions: Zohora's Hajj was completed with her brother and sister-in-law. Within her immediate group, she travelled closely with her brother, sister-in-law, and an elderly aunt, forming a core group of three females who stayed together to avoid getting separated.
• Accommodations: The agency arranged hotel stays in Makkah and Madinah.
• Duration: Zohora's trip was an extended package, lasting approximately 42 days.
• Sequence of Stay:
    ◦ Initially stayed in Makkah Sharif, where they performed Umrah, regularly performed Tawaf at the Kaaba, prayed in their rooms (especially Asr, Maghrib, and Isha), and recited the Quran. They also attended Jummah prayers there.
    ◦ The agency facilitated visits (Ziyarahs) to various religious and historical sites in Makkah and its surroundings, including a trip to Taif which led to another Umrah opportunity.
    ◦ Then, they spent about eight to nine days in Madinah Sharif, where they performed all five daily prayers and participated in Ziyarahs.
    ◦ Finally, they returned to Makkah Sharif to participate in the Hajj rituals.
• Food: Most meals (three times a day) were provided by the agency, so Zohora did not have many opportunities to eat outside or explore local food shops.
• Mobile Connectivity: Upon arrival at the hotel, a one-month Saudi SIM card was immediately activated for 500 Riyals. This SIM was recharged after its validity expired.
• Pre-Hajj Preparations:
    ◦ Agency's Role: The Shepherd agency provided thorough and long-term orientation covering physical, mental, and religious aspects of Hajj. This guidance began from the initial registration phase.
    ◦ Orientation Format: Orientations were communicated via a group chat and primarily held on weekends (Fridays or Saturdays) to accommodate service holders. These sessions explained potential problems, importance of physical fitness, mental preparedness, and religious rituals/worship. Information was shared through physical classes, virtual sessions (e.g., Zoom for expatriates), and supplementary books/documentation.
    ◦ Learning Preference: Zohora primarily attended in-person classes, finding them better for open discussions and learning from the experiences of previous pilgrims.
    ◦ Ritual Guidance: The agency provided step-by-step orientation for Hajj rituals, from airport preparation in Bangladesh to arrival in Makkah, hotel stay, and specific worship times during Hajj. They also provided books detailing prayers (Duas) and steps for rituals like Tawaf and prayers at Arafat. Zohora studied beforehand and also carried these books, reciting from them when memory failed.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Navigation and Exploration:
    ◦ Finding Shops/Restaurants: Zohora found it difficult to find the "best" shops for quality items or specific goods or to explore restaurants. She received no prior guidance from the agency and had to rely on wandering and personal judgement. She noted it was "absolutely impossible for us females" to explore individually.
    ◦ Getting Lost: In the vast and crowded Haram Sharif, it was very difficult to locate someone who got separated from the group. While no one in her group was completely lost, it often took significant time and repeated mobile communication to find them.
    ◦ Gate Closures and Crowds: Police frequently closed gates and roads, especially during prayer times and on Fridays, which was "quite distressing". This required extensive walking to find open alternatives, as they were unfamiliar with the many gates and direct paths to the Kaaba. Escalators suddenly stopping also caused unexpected detours. The random and frequent changes in routes by authorities posed a significant problem.
• Transportation:
    ◦ Difficulty for Women: Independent movement for women was hard due to lack of transport and unfamiliarity with areas.
    ◦ Logistics during Hajj: A major transport crisis was experienced when moving from Muzdalifah, with bus support issues and drivers unfamiliar with routes and speaking different languages, causing stress about reaching prayer spots on time. Some in her group failed to reach destinations on time for prayers.
• Information and Guidance:
    ◦ Lack of Specific Religious Information: There was no specific list of important spots where the Prophet (PBUH) made special Duas, or the significance of particular mosques in Mina or Arafat.
    ◦ Absence of Real-time Updates: There was a lack of real-time information regarding optimal times to perform rituals (e.g., stoning the Jamarat to avoid crowds) or when transport would be available. She also noted the absence of instant messages about incidents, such as a fire causing transport stoppages, which created confusion.
• Logistical Burden: Carrying excessive luggage was a physical strain, especially given the extensive walking required. Moving around during the day was difficult due to intense heat, making evenings the preferred time for outings.
• Language Barrier: While not a major issue in shops (due to many Bengali salesmen), it was problematic with transportation in Madinah, where most drivers spoke languages other than Bengali. Saudi SIM card messages in Arabic were also not understood, complicating operations.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Comprehensive Mobile App:
    ◦ Dua and Ritual Guide: A mobile app with short-listed Duas would be "very good" and "very effective" as mobiles are mandatory for pilgrims, eliminating the need to carry heavy books. It could include spot-specific information on significance and Sunnah practices at places like Arafat and Mina, and allow users to add personal Duas via voice or text.
    ◦ Shopping and Exploration Guide: An app resembling a "Yellow Pages" for nearby shops (e.g., for specific items like bags or food) with quality ratings, prices, and recommendations for hidden wholesale markets would be highly beneficial, saving time, physical effort, and transport costs.
    ◦ Location Sharing: An app enabling location sharing among group members and the wider caravan would be extremely useful for safety and preventing individuals from getting lost in crowded areas like Haram Sharif.
    ◦ Crowdsourced Real-time Information: A community-based system, similar to social media, where pilgrims could share real-time updates on gate closures, crowded mosque areas, or incidents, and receive notifications, would be "very good" for planning movements. However, Zohora expressed a caveat that the dynamic nature of gate closures might lead to quick message obsolescence and potential miscommunication. Such a system would ideally support local languages.
    ◦ Language Translation Feature: A built-in feature to translate urgent day-to-day instructions (e.g., hotel directions, food requests) via text or voice would be beneficial, though Zohora had not used one previously.
• Post-Hajj Spiritual Continuity: An app that provides regular reminders and guidance on post-Hajj religious duties (e.g., daily prayers, obligatory acts, Sunnah, Fard) would help pilgrims maintain their spiritual momentum and ensure continuity in their practices. Regular messages and updates would serve as a constant reminder, preventing "information gaps".
• App Pricing Model: Zohora suggested that a comprehensive Hajj app could be offered with a one-time fee for lifetime access, ideally included as part of the overall Hajj package. She believed that an amount like BDT 2,000-4,000 (£15-30) would not significantly impact the package cost and would be easily absorbed by agencies by adjusting other expenses like food. This would prevent pilgrims from feeling it as an "extra payment". A model with a one-year subscription included in the Hajj package, followed by free community access and a small fee for subsequent Umrah/Hajj trips, was also considered fair.
• Future Umrah Travel Support: While she has a desire to perform Umrah again, Zohora expressed that she would not feel fully confident arranging it completely independently (e.g., booking flights and hotels herself). She believes some form of support or guidance is still necessary for religious matters, hotel stays, and food arrangements. However, if an agency arranges everything and provides a comprehensive app (including Ziyarah spots, driver arrangements, audio/video clips explaining site significance), she feels it would be possible to perform Umrah without a constant physical guide, especially if accompanied by family members.
Quotes & Memorable Statements
• "Alhamdulillah, I performed Hajj in 2024. Before that, for a long time, I had this thought that I would, Insha'Allah, perform Hajj sometime in the future. So, with that thought, I was always wondering when I would perform Hajj, when that time would come." - Reflects her deep, long-standing desire to perform Hajj.
• "My family members who went the previous year, in '22, had a proven experience... It was all proven, and they assured us that they would provide these. Other agencies might have had a slight difference in budget... But we didn't have any proven experience with those agencies to go through them... Considering this, Shepherd seemed appropriate. I understand. So, referrals were a big deal for you in this case." - Highlights the importance of trusted referrals and proven service for Hajj agencies.
• "If the Hajj details are available on the mobile, I think this could be a good initiative and would be very effective. Because if I take a book, I have to carry extra weight... But my mobile will always be with me." - A strong endorsement for a mobile application for Hajj guidance.
• "The Haram Sharif is such a vast place with so many people that if someone from the group got separated, it was very difficult to find them." - Emphasises the immense challenge of group management in crowded holy sites.
• "If I know everything through the app – where to go, what Dua to recite, what kind of worship to perform, how to go from one place to another – and if there's also a list of transport support, which driver to contact, which hotel to stay in, then I don't think continuous guidance is needed. It can definitely be done by oneself, Insha'Allah." - A key statement indicating how a comprehensive digital solution could empower pilgrims and reduce reliance on constant physical guidance.
• "Since I won't get the opportunity to go repeatedly, if I make a mistake once, it will be a regret for a lifetime." - Illustrates the high stakes and the desire for accuracy in performing religious rituals.
Other Observations
• Gender-Specific Challenges: Zohora explicitly noted that for females, it was "impossible" to explore shops and restaurants independently due to unfamiliarity with the area, lack of transportation, and the general difficulty of moving around freely. This highlights comfort and safety concerns that are heightened for women.
• Importance of Group Cohesion: Her group, especially the female members, maintained very close communication and always moved together to prevent anyone from getting lost in the overwhelming crowds of Haram Sharif.
• Deep Spiritual Motivation: Zohora's responses consistently reflect a profound desire to perform Hajj and Umrah correctly, "beautifully and smoothly", and to avoid any mistakes in religious duties, emphasizing the lifelong regret such errors might cause.
• Post-Hajj Lifestyle: There is a clear intention to maintain and improve religious practices after Hajj, particularly the five daily prayers and other Islamic duties. She desires a system that continuously reminds and guides her to sustain this spiritual momentum.
