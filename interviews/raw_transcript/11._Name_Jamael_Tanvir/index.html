<p>Interview Transcript
Muhammad: This meeting is being recorded. Uh, Jamael bhai. Uh, thank you for your time to um, like, allow us to interview you. Uh, just to confirm, you are within the age group of um, 35 to 45 and right now you reside in Germany, right?
Jamael Tanvir: Um, I mean, I'm in the age group of 35 to 40, I would say, and I'm currently residing in Germany. Yes.
Muhammad: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um, so, uh, as per my knowledge, you have performed Umrah in uh, 2020, Hajj in 2022, and Umrah in 2023. Afterwards, have you uh, performed Umrah yourself?
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, yes, I uh, went uh, for Umrah last year as well. Um, so yeah, so there was another time that when I went for.
Muhammad: So last year when you went by yourself, have you went by an agency or you booked everything by yourself?
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, I did it by myself.
Muhammad: I see. I see. So how did you buy everything? Did you use a portal like Booking.com, Agoda.com, or you uh, got it uh, from a like agency and they just bought it for you based on your schedule?
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, actually, I booked it through Check24.de. So it's very popular in Germany. Uh, I mean, it is uh, used for many different purposes. Uh, hotel booking is one of them. Uh, and this Check24 also has connection with Booking.com, Agoda.com. Uh, I mean, they have the partnership with them. So if you search for some hotel, if that is not listed in Check24, then they can also search those uh, listings from Booking.com or similar similar uh, websites and list them into Check24. So it's very uh, you know, intuitive for users. So that's why it's very popular in Germany and that's what I used actually. And for visa processing also, I did it myself. Uh, I just went to the uh, so the visa portal and then applied for it.
Muhammad: Okay. Now um, you don't have, you have a Bangladeshi passport which, which requires uh, people to have Umrah visa. So, did, does it uh, work in that way or you are able to do Umrah with regular Saudi travel visa? Which one did you choose?
Jamael Tanvir: I, I actually applied for uh, travel visa that is um, uh, valid for one year and uh, also multiple entry possible. But when you uh, apply for visa, you can also mark that you want to perform Umrah. So that's what I did. Uh, and since I have um, uh, uh, the residence permit in Germany, so it also helps to get the visa easily.
Muhammad: I see. It makes sense. Makes sense. Um, so how was the um, you say like the booking experience was really good, like it was very seamless, right, from the website?
Jamael Tanvir: It was seamless. I mean, seamless in a sense that uh, um, the availability of hotels was uh, not an issue, but one issue I faced is uh, with the price. So if, I mean, I wanted to uh, find a hotel close to Kaaba uh, and when I searched for it, I found that the uh, price is a bit high on the high side. So, it was a bit difficult to find a hotel within my budget. That's one issue I faced.
Muhammad: Do you remember sharing which month you went uh, for the Umrah?
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, yes, I, I went there uh, uh, in the beginning of December last year.
Muhammad: I see. Early December is one of the most busy months. So I think that's maybe one of the uh, reasons. Um, so how was, and what kind of hotel you ended up booking? I think it's a, it's a three-star hotel. Um, it was pretty close to Kaaba, but uh, I mean, uh, alhamdulillah, it was uh, uh, more or less within my budget.
Muhammad: I see. Uh, did you walk to um, Kaaba from the hotel?
Jamael Tanvir: Yes, it was, you know, within the walking distance.
Muhammad: I see. And how was the service? Like, it advertised as three-star, but have you found the service is three-star or you feel service might not be three-star standard?
Jamael Tanvir: I mean, I mean, the service was uh, um, on par, I would say. I mean, I was not expecting much uh, from the hotel as well, but uh, overall, the um, quality was uh, I would say, good. I mean, considering it's a three-star hotel, also the staffs were very uh, you know, uh, very helpful and um, respectful, so which uh, I liked actually.
Muhammad: I see. I see. So you landed in the Jeddah airport and then went to the hotel, correct?
Jamael Tanvir: Yes.
Muhammad: So how was the commute from Jeddah to the hotel?
Jamael Tanvir: Um, the commute was fine, but uh, one um, challenge was to find uh, uh, a transport. I mean, um, there are a lot of uh, taxis available, but if you want to take a taxi, it's very, very expensive. Um, so I was actually looking for a cheaper option, and and you will also find a lot of um, you know, private cars, private cars, the who actually uh, you know, take people uh, from airport to the hotel, which is not legal uh, in a sense uh, that uh, the Saudi government actually uh, does not uh, you know, uh, how would I say, um,
Jamael Tanvir: I mean, it, I mean, it's not, I, I would say it's not allowed, but it's regulated. I mean, if they find out, they will definitely uh, uh, I mean, take some action against the against the owner of the car. Uh, so that's the from that perspective it's not allowed, but they do not usually uh, you know, bother much, but yeah, I mean, these options are there, so I took uh, one of these options actually to go to hotel from airport.
Muhammad: So how was your haggling experience? So when you started, when they quoted a price, do you have an idea that what was a fair price or you used your intuition to haggle?
Jamael Tanvir: Um, so I asked other people who used this service before, uh, and based on that I got some idea, and obviously when we ask that I will go to this hotel, this area, uh, they will ask for more money. Then uh, I had to bargain and um, then we came to an agreement that, yeah, we will, uh, I will pay this amount, and then uh, they agreed, and then we started. That's how it went.
Muhammad: Uh, okay, makes sense. Um, have you considered riding the train?
Jamael Tanvir: Train uh, was uh, in my mind to be very honest, but I didn't take the train for one reason, because I had a lot of luggages. Because uh, so uh, the Jeddah airport was kind of a stopover for me, because I was after, after performing Umrah and staying there for four days, I uh, went to Bangladesh. So I basically came with a lot of luggages. So one problem I thought is that after uh, you know, reaching the uh, Makkah station, I still have to find some transportation to go to hotel because I cannot um, like, for, for example, take a, take a bus to uh, reach somewhere and bus would uh, leave me somewhere uh, far from the hotel. So I still have to walk to the hotel. So this is why I thought that if, if I can take a car, then I can directly uh, reach to hotel. And then it would be easy to, easy for me to carry the luggages, which is why I didn't take the train.
Muhammad: I see. So, if you don't have luggages, then you would have taken the train; that makes sense.
Muhammad: Okay. So, in terms of sightseeing into Makkah and also doing shopping and food, you have been there a couple of times, so you know all the places that are there. But, do you think someone who goes for the first time would benefit from an app that tells them where all the popular markets are and where some of the good places to eat food are? Do you think something like that would help?
Muhammad: I think that would help a lot. I mean, someone who hasn't traveled to Jeddah or Makkah has no idea where to find what. It's a puzzle, in my opinion, this area around Kaaba. It's very difficult to find hotels, find routes to go to Haram, and find restaurants to eat, and also shopping, etc. It's actually very difficult and it's kind of a puzzle if someone is going there for the first time. But once someone goes there and roams around, maybe after that they will get some experience, but the first time it's very difficult. So, if there is something or some apps which will help to go to certain locations for certain things, obviously that will help a lot.
Muhammad: Yeah. Uh, that's fine. Uh, so for example um, I think uh, if uh, we show um, like we ask people what kind of food they want to eat and then uh, we will prescribe some places with high budget, more like a high budget. For example, somebody wants to eat maybe uh, Pakistani curries, that we can show like, like a cheaper option and also like a better option where it's like inside a mall, things like that. And also for like shopping, we want, we ask them what are some of, some of the things in your shopping list, and we can show them all the markets from there that they can buy, and we can also give them review of other people, what they feel like shopping experience from those particular market. Um, do you think uh, that would be a right approach to integrate into the app or if you have other ideas?
Jamael Tanvir: No, I think, I think this is a good idea. Uh, for example, filtering uh, the cuisine would be uh, one of the best options, because there are many people who actually cannot, can't uh, cannot uh, you know, uh, uh, taste different cuisines from different countries.
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, especially there are many Bangladeshis who cannot actually eat anything other than Bangladeshi food. So, uh, it's important for him to find some Bangladeshi restaurants around the Haram area, and not all of them are, you know, uh, very visible from the public space. So if the app can give this filtering option, that will definitely, definitely help. And also in terms of shopping, especially if uh, someone wants to buy uh, dates, for example, uh, they definitely, he definitely needs to find the right place to buy the dates because uh, the shops near the Haram area, they are very expensive and they may not be the fresh, uh, the fresh dates may not be available there. So uh, if the app can actually provide some information regarding this, obviously it will help a lot.
Muhammad: I see. I see. No, that makes sense. In terms of sightseeing, right? I think, I think when people want to uh, visit Makkah and Madina, they also want to do sightseeing. Uh, they want to visit various places in Madina that have linked to historical ties and also various places to Makkah that have linked historical ties. Right?
Muhammad: So there are many uh, such places that have authenticated narration, like this place is famous for this, and there are many places that have like, like fabled narration, so people say so when such and such happened, but it's not verified by Islamic um, historians. So do you think if we can create an itinerary place uh, based uh, like exploration plan for people where people can see what are some of the places they can go in Makkah and outskirts of Makkah, like Taif, uh, in various mountains of Makkah, uh, like famous spots for uh, Hajj, and same for Madina, and it has like an uh, audio video overview that is uh, telling why certain places are famous, so people can arrange uh, self-guided tours. Um, do you think such a thing would add value towards people or people generally able to find it by themselves or by group?
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, I think it's a good idea to have this kind of information in the app uh, itself. Uh, and you are correct that uh, this information is not readily available and there are different uh, narrations, different stories about different places. Um, uh, people would not generally find them uh, by themselves. Uh, it's uh, it's a good idea to provide this information in the app.
Jamael Tanvir: But I would also suggest one thing: if it's possible to uh, connect some uh, travel guide or travel agency, I, I don't know exactly how to say it in terms of um, uh, in terms of uh, this sightseeing. So if uh, it's possible to connect some um, travel agencies within Saudi Arabia who can actually take to places which are authentic based on Islamic history. Uh, that would actually help the, help the Hajis to, you know, uh, follow and uh, and um, understand. Maybe, if, maybe uh, it can be uh, something uh, for the next steps, but I would uh, highly suggest to uh, you know, consider this.
Muhammad: I see. No, that's, that's very great advice. Uh, now in terms of uh, preparation for Hajj and Umrah, like as you went to Hajj as your first trip, obviously you were trained on how to do Hajj and how to do Umrah. Now do you think this training can be done online both for Hajj and Umrah prior to uh, the trip, maybe three months prior? You will have like an on-demand uh, video uh, like and audio-visual course that uh, you can see in your free time, but it also has a schedule that it will guide you that um, module by module that you need to finish uh, within three months for a self-learning um, so that you get more prepared uh, for Hajj and Umrah um, both logistically and spiritually. Do you think such a course would add value to the pilgrims?
Jamael Tanvir: It's very important. I, I can actually share my experience regarding this. Uh, first of all, someone who is intending to go for Hajj or Umrah, I mean, it's always better to have some um, training in person. For example, uh, when I went for Hajj, my agency actually did a uh, you know, how do I say um,
Muhammad: One day, like day-long training session, right?
Jamael Tanvir: Day-long training session. And it, it happened actually multiple occasions, not only just one day, but it happened multiple occasions on different topics. It actually helped a lot to learn and understand things about Hajj and Umrah. But when it was about time to leave for Makkah, uh, I was still uh, in kind of a panic situation, a panic uh, mode that uh, am I, am I going to do it properly or am I going to make mistakes? So I was actually looking for tutorials online. For example, how to wear Ihram, uh, that was one of the challenges for me. Uh, because it was my first time. So I was uh, looking for videos how to perform uh, uh, sorry, how to wear Ihram, uh, and I was uh, looking into many videos. And many different videos, the brothers or the people who were uh, showing the way of wearing, they were different. I mean, there are obviously different ways to wear. So I, I found different uh, different videos and and it was giving me different ways. So I was also getting a bit more confused because I was also trying those different ways to wear Ihram, um, I was also getting confused.
Jamael Tanvir: So if, if an app that can give me uh, a comprehensive uh, training course, that will help me in a sense that I don't have to look for it in different places. For example, YouTube. Uh, and I can, I can just go, it, the app can become my go-to companion to find whatever I need. So, for example, if I need to uh, check the videos how to uh, wear Ihram, I just go there and check it. Uh, if I need to uh, know how to uh, perform Tawaf or Sai, I can just go there and uh, check it. So that will definitely help as, as a first-timer at least. Obviously, if I go there multiple times, uh, it will still help because something, for example, is not done regularly. So, uh, I tend, as a, as a, as a Haji, I will uh, forget after some time how to do it. So it will definitely help me uh, brush up my memory and then uh, uh, you know, just uh, uh, get myself prepared for this.
Muhammad: Okay. Um, great. Now in terms of uh, authenticity, uh, uh, do you think um, like having like a certification from uh, Islamic institution would be enough or do you want the lecture to be delivered by a renowned Islamic uh, teacher? So uh, but in my opinion, it, it's uh, it's a gray area, I would say, gray area in a sense that people uh, have different uh, different, I mean, people come from different uh,
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, sects, uh, by sects, I mean, the different school of thoughts.
Muhammad: Yeah.
Jamael Tanvir: So uh, naturally they have different ways of performing things. I'm only considering Bangladesh uh, when I'm talking about this uh, and someone, for example, who follows Hanafi, he's very strict about it and he does not follow anything else or he does not want to follow anything else. So, uh, I think from that point of view, it would be better if the app can provide uh, you know, rulings from different school of thoughts.
Muhammad: I see.
Jamael Tanvir: So that the user can choose which one he wants to listen to. Uh, obviously it has to be backed by uh, Quran and Sunnah for sure. No doubt about that. But since uh, I mean, the school of thoughts are prominent, I uh, it would be better to uh, have content from different school of thoughts just to uh, you know, uh, have the flexibility for the user to choose uh, which one he wants to listen to or read to.
Muhammad: I see, you know, that makes sense. Um, now in terms of during Hajj and Umrah, I think um, like you saw like our app, what do you think like having this like checklist style app? Would it be helpful?
Muhammad: Uh, checklist of what could be, the app I just showed you right before the call, like the mobile app, yeah. Do you think such an app would be helpful where all the steps and all the action items are there?
Jamael Tanvir: Definitely, definitely, that would help. For example, uh, I, I checked the Umrah guide which is like uh, an action um, guide which is, which I really liked. Um, so for example, when we are doing Tawaf, it's very easy to forget how many laps I did. So if I have a counter, that would definitely, definitely help um, not to uh, not to be bothered about the count. So and I can uh, I can actually concentrate on making duas, so that will definitely help.
Muhammad: I see. Now regarding the app, one of the things people complain that uh, two things, right? First of all, they feel like one of the main problems with the app is sometimes it creates lots of distraction, because example, you are off and all sorts of random notifications started coming. And second problem people said, uh, some, when it is very rush, then uh, following an app is very difficult because your phone might break, like you might lose, lost your phone and stuff. What's your suggestion? How do you think we can mitigate those challenges? Um, one thing that, that's come uh, that's coming to my mind right now is uh, uh, integrating a watch app with the, with the main app.
Jamael Tanvir: So that uh, the uh, Haji does not need to uh, open the phone. He can keep it uh, in the, in his belt, for example, and from watch he can follow everything.
Muhammad: It would be very easy. I see. Um, also I think it can have connection towards Bluetooth and um, it can take certain voice commands. So for example, if the Haji wants to get reminded about uh, certain dua regarding family, it can tell you what the duas that need to be there. Or if Haji asks like uh, when Haji feels like finish a Tawaf, it can just notify the app like, "finish Tawaf" and it can report. So just using AI like a Tawaf component. Do you think that would create more noise or it would add easiness for Hajj?
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, so it uh, it depends in my opinion. I mean, if I want to do too many things, it might get uh, a bit tricky. Uh, so let's say if the watch gives you, I mean, I, I as a user give a command to the watch, and let's say I want to uh, listen to some dua, for example, because watch would not be uh, the right place to read the dua because it, it doesn't have enough space. So the, what's the solution? Solution is that it will play the dua. Uh, but when it's noisy, when it's very uh, you know, the traffic, I mean, the crowd is very big, it might be a bit difficult to uh, hear the uh, dua. So that's one problem I can see uh, in that, in that case. But uh, if I just want to keep it minimal, for example, I just want to keep track of my laps um, and and what else?
Muhammad: Maybe some uh,
Muhammad: Duas that you want to make, some reminder regarding the dua.
Jamael Tanvir: Exactly. Uh, maybe it can remind me some duas that I already know. Uh, that might, might be helpful. And also since watch has, usually the smartwatches have GPS, the GPS can already track the laps by itself.
Muhammad: Yeah. I think the main problem with that uh, because people are uh, like, it's not fairing in a so small um, area, the slightest error might create a false positive uh, nuance, and I think this is too risky to introduce that.
Muhammad: That's true. So that is one reason we are trying to avoid like an automated one. Um, it can be semi-automated, it can suggest that, okay, have you completed a lap and then user can tap yes or no, something like that. But I think completely relying on GPS might be a problem. Um, correct. Right. I agree. Um.
Muhammad: So regarding the dua module that you have seen, like it's like a blank state, right? But one of the main things that people do in Hajj and Umrah is dua, right? Like there are lots of stories that people made dua in Hajj, they made dua in Umrah, they made dua in certain places in Arafah which get uh, accepted by Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala, right? And but many people complain like they have nothing to make dua about. Right. So how do you think a module can help? Right? So it will help people to juggle their mind and bring all the duas in front. How do you think something like that can help?
Muhammad: Um, it definitely helps. For example, when I perform Tawaf, I usually uh, I usually um, follow this application uh, uh, what's the name, the Sunnah Duas um,
Muhammad: By Green Tech, right?
Jamael Tanvir: Sorry.
Muhammad: By Green Tech app, you meant?
Jamael Tanvir: Yes, yes, exactly. I mean, this is very, I mean, uh, it's, it actually comes as a form of book. It's very popular book, how, how did I name it?
Jamael Tanvir: Hisnul Muslim, exactly. Hisnul Muslim. So it has a huge list of duas uh, from Rasulullah and also from Quran. So uh, when I do this Tawaf or Sai, I actually continue reading dua from this. So I can only imagine if uh, this app also has uh, some listing of these duas, popular duas, that would definitely help. And obviously uh, if a user can, you know, um, choose some duas from them, their, I mean, his favorite duas, for example, the duas that are very relevant to his life, and make them favorite, and then later he can just open those favorite duas and just uh, read them, that would definitely help a lot.
Muhammad: I see.
Muhammad: Okay. Um, now the coming to the next point is, and that's the last section we're going to cover: how impactful our Umrah is. So to make our Umrah really spiritually transformative and um, to have like a long-lasting effect uh, after completing Umrah, so that when we go into a regular life, we don't become the same person as we were before Umrah, rather we transform into a better version of our past selves. How do you think an app like this can help?
Jamael Tanvir: Uh, okay. It's a difficult question. Um, so I think uh, I think what gives me better clarity about these things are um, the things or or the uh, or the workshops or the meetings that uh, I have or I had before going to Makkah. So the preparation actually helps uh, or helped me a lot to reflect on those things. I mean, the actual action uh, is something that is uh, an aftermath of the preparation in my opinion.
Jamael Tanvir: So uh, to, I mean, understand or to uh, feel the importance of these actions, you really need to learn what you are going to do. So from that point of view, if uh, this app can provide all these contents that helps the user to understand that you are going to perform these things and what what are the, you know, benefits, what are the significance of this, what are the significance of these things, uh, uh, then the user will be able to understand that, yes, I'm going to do these actions, I, I'm going to perform Umrah, I'm going to uh, go for Hajj and perform these actions. Then he will feel within himself that, yes, now I'm doing something that is a very, very important part of my life that automatically helps the Hajis to reflect upon it. But if someone just goes there directly without any preparation or anything, without understanding what he's going to do, I, I, I would think that it will not really help him understand or reflect uh, in his life, help him reflect in his life.
Jamael Tanvir: So uh, so as I, as I, as I was saying, uh, from that point of view, if the app can give the user a proper preparation, that should automatically help the user to, you know, reflect and ponder upon those things. And also, um, for example, when we go for Hajj with the travel agency, uh, usually they try to uh, arrange some um, uh, halaqah with uh, with scholars, that also helps a lot uh, to reflect on these things. Uh, so maybe uh, the app also can contain some uh, video contents from some renowned scholars regarding these topics, maybe that can also help the user to, you know, uh, watch and reflect on those things.
Muhammad: I see. So just to summarize, if I say like when you are doing training and when you are doing the Umrah itself, you are making certain duas, that time you have a very like high spiritual state. And then if we can enable uh, the journaling within the app, so you write down your thoughts, your raw points, your raw ideas, and using LLM, we can create like a three-month plan or some uh, pledge you can follow for the rest of your life. Uh, this can include uh, like praying regularly in masjid, reading Quran uh, regularly or being like a better person. And after even you perform the Umrah, the app uh, reminds you to do certain things. And I think that would be beneficial for you, right?
Jamael Tanvir: Yes, absolutely. I mean, um, it's a good point that you made about uh, you know, writing a journal or, you know, uh, using AI LLM to communicate your intention uh, so that you get some feedback. So these things actually help since we have this technology uh, at hand. Obviously, you can, we can leverage these things and try to utilize and find a good solution from, from these things. So I, I think it's a good point that you made, and if it's possible to incorporate these things into the app, uh, it will definitely, definitely help.
Muhammad: Okay.
Muhammad: I think uh, that's all the questions I have. So I'd like to finish by asking you to ask uh, like your suggestion, your commitment, and like the monetary challenge of the monetary system of the app. So if we make an app like that, and next time you perform Umrah, if we like you to buy this app, I believe, would you be comfortable? And if you are, then how much do you think would be a fair amount of money to charge for such an app um, as a one-time purchase?
Jamael Tanvir: So um, yeah, I mean, I was thinking uh, there, there could be two options. One is uh, this uh, one-time purchase, and another one is a subscription-based model. Um, maybe, maybe in this case, uh, one-time purchase is uh, more suitable because uh, we do not perform Umrah every month or every year, maybe uh, or every two, three months, usually it's not the case. So subscription-based model may not be suitable. Uh, uh, so in case of one-time purchase, I would think, um, I don't know actually, um, so it depends on what the app can provide. So if,
Muhammad: Everything we discussed like.
Jamael Tanvir: Yeah, I mean, if, if the app can provide everything that we discussed, maybe, maybe uh, I don't know, something between um, 20 to $30 in terms of, I'm just saying in terms of dollars, maybe $20 to $30 should be, should be fine, good enough, I think. So if I, instead of offering one-time payment, if it's uh, give you like a yearly subscription, so you pay for and the content will remain there for a year, so in that case, uh, how much do you think might be good? Um, okay, in case of this kind of subscription model, um, uh, I would think um, I would say $10.
Jamael Tanvir: I mean, I'm, it's uh, kind of difficult to calculate at this point. Maybe, maybe later I can give you better insight about this uh, because it involves a lot of, lot of, lot of uh, factors uh, which uh, may not be possible for me to think at this point, but uh, definitely I will try to share more information, more insight later.
Muhammad: Okay, makes sense. Makes sense.
Muhammad: So, Insha'Allah, if it is okay, we will communicate with you uh, down the line regarding this and ask your suggestion to be a better tester with us, right?
Jamael Tanvir: Sure, Insha'Allah, I'll be happy to comment, I mean, discuss about these things.
Muhammad: Okay, okay. Thank you, Jamael Bhai, uh, for your time. I think this has been really wonderful talking with you and getting so many beneficial insights uh, from you, um, and thank you very much uh, for it. Uh, thank you very much to you as well. It was nice talking to you and I uh, I hope and I make dua to Allah that uh, you uh, you know, whatever we discussed, you can actually find uh, you know, uh, implement those things in the app and it will be, Insha'Allah, very, very beneficial to the users.</p>
<h3 id="interview-notes">Interview Notes:</h3>
<p>Background Information
• Age and Residency: Jamael Tanvir is in the age group of 35 to 40 and currently resides in Germany.
• Trip Types and Years: He performed Umrah in 2020, Hajj in 2022, and Umrah in 2023. He also went for Umrah last year (in addition to the 2023 trip mentioned).
• Travel Arrangements:
    ◦ His recent Umrah trip was performed by himself, not through an agency.
    ◦ His Hajj trip was organised through an agency that provided day-long training sessions on multiple occasions.
• Visa: He has a Bangladeshi passport but a residence permit in Germany, which helped him get a visa easily. He applied for a one-year, multiple-entry travel visa, marking that he intended to perform Umrah.
Journey / Context
• Booking Process:
    ◦ He booked his hotel through Check24.de, which is very popular in Germany and has partnerships with Booking.com and Agoda.com, making it intuitive for users.
    ◦ Visa processing was also done personally by applying through the official visa portal.
• Accommodation: He booked a three-star hotel that was pretty close to Kaaba and within walking distance. He found the service quality to be good, and the staff were very helpful and respectful.
• Commute from Jeddah Airport:
    ◦ He landed in Jeddah airport, which was a stopover before he travelled to Bangladesh, meaning he had a lot of luggage.
    ◦ The commute to the hotel was generally fine, but finding transport was a challenge.
    ◦ He opted for a private car, as taxis were very expensive, even though private cars operate in a grey area of legality in Saudi Arabia. He haggled the price based on prior research from others who used similar services.
    ◦ He did not take the train due to the large amount of luggage he had, as he would still need to find further transportation from the Makkah station to his hotel. He preferred the directness of a car for carrying luggage.
• Activities in Makkah: His activities included performing Umrah (Tawaf and Sai), as well as general sightseeing, shopping, and eating.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Hotel Cost: He faced an issue with hotel prices; it was difficult to find a hotel close to Kaaba within his budget because prices were quite high, especially as he travelled in early December, which is a busy month.
• Airport Transportation: Finding affordable transport from Jeddah airport was a challenge, as official taxis were very expensive, and he had to resort to semi-legal private cars.
• First-time Visitor Orientation: For someone going to Makkah for the first time, navigating the area around Kaaba (finding hotels, routes to Haram, restaurants, and shopping) is "very difficult and it's kind of a puzzle".
• Ritual Guidance and Panic: Despite agency training for Hajj, he felt a "panic situation, a panic mode" about performing rituals correctly, especially wearing Ihram for the first time. He found online tutorials varied, which further confused him.
• Keeping Track of Rituals: It is "very easy to forget how many laps" one has completed during Tawaf.
• App-Related Distractions and Risks:
    ◦ Apps can create "lots of distraction" due to random notifications.
    ◦ In very crowded situations, following an app is difficult, and there's a risk of the phone breaking or being lost.
    ◦ Automated Tawaf lap tracking via GPS might be "too risky to introduce" due to "the slightest error" in a small area potentially causing false positives.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Comprehensive Hajj/Umrah App: He believes an app that acts as a "go-to companion" would be highly beneficial, providing all necessary information in one place without needing to search elsewhere (e.g., YouTube).
• Enhanced Navigation and Information:
    ◦ An app would "help a lot" for first-time visitors to find popular markets and good places to eat in Jeddah and Makkah.
    ◦ Filtering options for cuisine (e.g., Bangladeshi food) are crucial, especially for those who prefer specific types of food.
    ◦ Information on where to buy items like fresh dates at fair prices would be valuable, as shops near Haram are expensive and may not offer fresh produce.
• Sightseeing and Historical Tours:
    ◦ The app should include an itinerary or exploration plan for historical places in Makkah (including Taif and mountains) and Madina.
    ◦ This should feature audio/video overviews explaining why certain places are famous, enabling self-guided tours.
    ◦ He suggests the app could also connect users with travel agencies within Saudi Arabia that can offer authentic tours based on Islamic history.
• Online Training and Preparation:
    ◦ "It's very important" to have a comprehensive online training course for Hajj and Umrah, offered three months prior to the trip.
    ◦ This course should be on-demand with audio-visual content and a modular schedule for self-learning, preparing pilgrims logistically and spiritually.
    ◦ It would help first-timers and allow repeat pilgrims to "brush up" their memory.
• Multi-School of Thought Content: The app should provide rulings from different Islamic schools of thought (e.g., Hanafi) to offer flexibility, ensuring content is backed by Quran and Sunnah.
• Checklist-Style App: A checklist-style app with all steps and action items, like an Umrah guide, would be "definitely, definitely helpful".
• Tawaf Lap Counter: A counter within the app would "definitely, definitely help" pilgrims to concentrate on making duas without worrying about the count.
• Smartwatch Integration: To mitigate distractions and phone risks, integrating a watch app with the main app would allow pilgrims to follow everything from their watch, keeping their phone secure. It could track laps and remind users of duas.
• Dua Module:
    ◦ The app should include a listing of popular duas (e.g., from Hisnul Muslim).
    ◦ Users should be able to favourite duas that are relevant to their life for easy access.
• Spiritual Transformation and Reflection:
    ◦ Preparation (through workshops, meetings, or app content) is crucial for pilgrims to understand the benefits and significance of the actions they are performing. This understanding automatically helps them reflect and ponder.
    ◦ The app could contain video content from renowned scholars on these spiritual topics.
    ◦ He suggests incorporating a journaling feature within the app for pilgrims to write down thoughts and ideas during their high spiritual state.
    ◦ Using AI/LLM to create a post-Umrah plan or pledges (e.g., praying regularly, reading Quran, being a better person) based on journaling would be beneficial. The app could then remind users to follow these pledges.
• Monetary Model: He suggests a one-time purchase model is more suitable than a subscription-based model because Umrah/Hajj is not performed every month or year. For an app that provides everything discussed, he suggests a price between $20 to $30 for a one-time purchase. If a yearly subscription were the only option, he estimates around $10.
