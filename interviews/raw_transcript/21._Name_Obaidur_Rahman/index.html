  <h1>21. Name Obaidur Rahman</h1>

<h2 id="21-name-obaidur-rahman">21. Name: Obaidur Rahman</h2>
<h3 id="raw-interview">Raw Interview:</h3>
<p>Muhammad: This meeting is being recorded. So asalam allayikum uh brother uh thank you very much uh for joining uh with interview. Uh so just to confirm uh you are your age group is between uh 35 to 45 and you are currently a resident of Canada. Is it correct?
Obaid: Country if I'm in I I am of that age group and I submit the group.
Muhammad: Okay. So first I want to ask you uh can you share uh since uh when you have performed Hajj or Umra um and uh which year was it and how many times?
Obaid: Five times it was it was all last year between the time frame of August of last year till December of last year. I see. And did during back then you used to live in Madina, right?
Obaid: Yes, I was a teacher in Lina. I'll be teacher.
Muhammad: Okay. So, have any of your Omra trip was um organized and planned by an agency or you like all of them you do it by yourself?
Obaid: Because I was a resident of Medina, alhamdulillah, it was very easy for me and I was able to do them by myself. I was able to arrange transportation and accommodation I use it by myself.
Muhammad: Okay. So I'd like to know like being a local how would you arrange the transportation and hotels.
Obaid: First and foremost you ask other people who have gone for Umbra themselves who have been residents there or citizens there for a long time. You ask them about the hotels you ask them where have they had good experiences and things like that. And regarding the transportation as well which transport which particular bus stop or which particular taxi stop is good to go to and take the transport from there. So based on you can say peer reviews anybody who has gone there before based on their experience and their suggestions I would go um the I because I was a teacher in Madina I also had co-workers who kind of volunteered with sponsors there are many adult sponsors that go ahead and pay for a certain number of people's Omrah and they pay for transportations and buses and everything. So the people the people who go for Omra the groups they never find out who is the sponsor. They never find out how much it costed them because it is all covered. So I've also gone with my co-workers once in that manner on a big very I would say luxurious bus. The other times I have either driven with a friend of mine or I have even uh how do you say this taken public transport from private rental company that have offered as Bombi.
Muhammad: Okay. So you you so you most of the time you went with either public transportation or you use sponsored or you sell transportation. Have you ever hire a get a taxi for transportation?
Obaid: Yeah. Yeah. So we used to go to the public taxi spots and we would go and uh by we I mean me and my coworker who want who want to have company with me. So I would go with them to those public stores and I would uh just eat the I just go with them.
Muhammad: Okay. So lots of the people their main challenge was finding like the right transportation because many of them they feel like the taxi company they do lot their business model is more like extortion. So they understand like the people who come from Omrah or Hajj they are vulnerable. So they ask like very high prices for them. So this is uh according to many of the people who went to Omrah this is true for within the city of Makkah and Medina. and also like intercity travel from Makkai Modina. So what advice would you give people who want to get a taxi or uh travel within the city with the taxi? What advice would you give them uh and how to avoid them or do you also feel the challenge yourself as well?
Obaid: I never found that as a local that is because I had a lot of people that I could ask to how much did they spend on keeps themselves. So whenever somebody was misquing a price but I was asking a bit too much. I automatically knew that wasn't a reasonable price and I knew how much I could bargain it down. So yes, that can happen. I have not seen that to be a rampant uh regularity there that people are being asked too much but it being aware how much it costs. I was always able to bargain down to the right price.
Muhammad: I see. I see. So you you know the right price so you are able to bargain. So do you think uh in an uh if somebody says I want to go point A to point B and it suggest like a price range right uh then that that would help right
Obaid: yes of course u also if there is an availability I don't know if you have heard of another company but it's it's a really big one from Pennsylvania it's called field nation it's a software service I used to work for them once upon a time they have gained a lot of market in Canada as well when I used to work for them were primarily in the states So what they do is they have people who need work and people who want to work. So technicians and companies that need these techniques. So if it could be an app, there's a platform for not only people like me who are customers to go and find the right price for the right transportation but also there are there's an opportunity for these taxi drivers or public transport companies to post how much they are going to charge for that trip. That would be an amazing platform for people to explore. Yes. Yes. So regarding that I think Uber is some Uber and Kharim is somewhat already doing that in Madina but I'm really surprised uh there is no such things for interc city transport and also I think in Makkah Uber and Karim is not available. So is there any regulation issue you are aware of like why Uber and Kharim is not operable there?
Obaid: I am not aware of any regulation issue but I do understand that Uber and Karim whatever they charge any local company any local taxi driver will charge lessly.
Muhammad: Okay. So you feel Uber is charging more than what local taxi would have charged right?
Obaid: Yes of course.
Muhammad: So as a local of Madina would you use Uber for going point A to point B or you also take taxi?
Obaid: As the last resort I always took uh the service of private car owners or taxi drivers.
Muhammad: Oh okay. And you know
Obaid: by taxi I would never by taxi I don't mean the taxi of Medina the government that is running the taxi not that one there are private companies private private vehicles um they have no markings on them they don't even have a sign that says Uber on them but they always go street to street and they ask people if they can be their chauffeur and their price
Muhammad: the challenge of reliability comes in right so uh so for for you in a local it's might easier for you to find those things. But people who are uh foreigner in that country who come to Haj and Umrah, how do you think we can ensure like the unmarked taxi vehicle who are not registered uh they cannot use them for their advantage, right? Or like uh don't take them in weird area or something like that. How is there any uh way or or something that you think can help?
Obaid: Well, for for situations like that, there's always an app like Uber or or even taxi. But when it comes to managing your finances and finding a cheaper alternative, yes, if you have uh concern that um these private taxis might not be safe, I don't know if I'm being taken to the right location or not. Any other app, probably an app that new app that can be designed that offers a little bit of reliability like that would certainly be a game changer.
Muhammad: I see. Makes sense. Makes sense. Uh now it comes to hotel right. Uh one of the biggest complaint um I have seen many Umra pilgrim says is number one when they book a hotel usually they advertise like twostar, three star, fourstar hotel but the quality is not like a threestar hotel like the service is really bad. Uh sometimes they feel like uh like they booked a hotel uh from outside uh the country but when they comes in they says like oh uh there's no reservation. there or the hotel is over booked so hotel already sold there things. Uh I myself felt that once like I booked through Agoda and when I come to the hotel they find my bookings then they says like oh uh you booked it but unfortunately we sold this room for you so we have to move into another room. So it create lots of hassle for foreigner as well. How did you find when you book up accommodation and what suggestion would you give to find like the right accommodation to foreigners who come for Hajanra? foreigners when they come to Amra they do not have the privilege of spending their time walking around and asking uh going door to door of hotels and asking for that's a certainty um in that case the best way that most foreigners seem to operate in Montina they end up going to hotels that have a brand name that have been there for a long time like uh off the top of my head because I thought there I have a student of mine whose father owns Pullman Zam. So everybody knows Pman Zam. It's a renowned hotel. They stay there. Everybody knows. Everybody knows. So people usually to find it safe, they have to spend a lot of money and go to these hotels that are renowned with these booking issues. Even if they have them, they're they're few. They're not major occurrences.
Muhammad: I see. So like um so so you suggesting like foreigner they should look for like more reliable option instead of shop around and finding thrift option. It is safer to find reliable option here right?
Obaid: Yes.
Muhammad: Okay. Um there is one thing that's like how many uh agency like they work there is a a pyramid scheme of buying like buying and selling hotel. So usually hotel owner um they sell it to one party and then they sell it to another party then then like by the time like the like the pilgrim they got the hotel it gone through gone through either four or five hands and those the hotel is reliable in that case but the hotel price kind of get increased so in many occasion the price become like 50% more than what the hotel owner get paid uh is there any way like the pilgrim can shorten this uh chain and get like a better deal
Obaid: well Canada and other place so you have some really reliable websites right Booking.com and other websites that are more reliable. Uh if if there was a platform as such where hotel owners directly could come and advertise and people could also find out that okay this is I can I can communicate directly with the hotel owners that would that would certainly reduce the hassle that people will be facing if it's directly in communication with the hotel bookings and everything.
Muhammad: But does hotel owner uh over they are comfortable selling their hotel in B2C or they want to sell it to someone else who would then then sell the hotel to other people
Obaid: they will go for the they usually go for the uh the shortcut that's available if they see that they can sell B2C they'll go for it if they see that okay we can do it just like realtors work over here in the west put up my listing to the realtor and the realtors end up selling it for me and I get a decent price they will go for that they they're going to be I think of culture they want the least amount of cash
Muhammad: I see I see so if if a company comes in and they take over that real trucks role they and then I think they can give it into a cheaper price to the people right
Muhammad: hello can you hear me hello Hello. Okay. So, um in terms of like the regulation, uh so for example, if a foreign company wants to come here and take the realtor's role, do you are you aware of how the regulation works or or do you know someone uh who work in that industry very closely?
Obaid: I am not aware of anybody who works in that industry closely. Unfortunately, one of the main challen Just for me while I was in Ma was how busy my job was. Due to that reason I couldn't really explore these options but u it all has to do with how well communication is between you and whichever part of the government is responsible for this. So the biggest the biggest uh the biggest issue there is language. So there is somebody who is able to communicate and explain the ide to the government official whoever they may be then for sure it is going to pass whatever uh doors and offices that are there. So it's all about explaining to the authorities what it is that wants that needs to be set up. Is it a company? Is it an app? Uh what are the services being offered? And especially uh there is a big how do how do I say this? There's a big u motivation for the Saudi government to work in the tech sector because they want that vision 2030. They're trying to accomplish that because of that reason you it's a good tech idea which can be pitched to them in a manner that is uh not only seems feasible for them but also seems to be beneficial for pilgrims, beneficial for the local population. There is no reason for not jumping.
Muhammad: I see what you're saying. Um now let's go to the next point. of your Omrah experience like uh how do you so when you you have done Omrah multiple times uh now you don't live in Saudi Arabia however uh but if you want to do Omrah right now would you go through an agency or you do it like a do it yourself like self-guided tool
Obaid: my first preference would always be to to manage it by myself but again uh there are barely any individuals who do not like communities right the entire concepts Walmart and fast food companies has come into existence because we as human beings without convenience. So if an option was given to me that offered me this convenience of being like a one-stop shop where I can go and I can book my ride and book my accommodation I can book my scale and I know when I compare with my local friends and co-workers there that the price that I'm paying is not too different or too high in comparison to me. arranging it all by myself then of course I would convenient with onetop shop
Muhammad: I see okay make sense makes sense um uh in terms of your Omrah experience like when you first time went to Omrah how prepare you think yourself was and how do you take the preparation for the spiritually like regarding like the dua like the uh like things you need to do and what are the challenge you faced regarding that I did not really face any challenges regarding uh preparing for the own.
Obaid: I I guess the biggest geograph the biggest challenge was the geographical one knowing exactly which door to enter from uh which way to turn which which washrooms are the most convenient to use if you are doing uh s. So it was a geographical challenge rather than uh the ritualistic what it's like what should I do after this? What should I do after that? Because even the Saudi government set up some really nice YouTube pages that highlights these pilgrims. I think was one of the pages that on YouTube would highlight the entire process of the smaller pilgrimage the major pilgrimage very nicely with proper infographics. So it wasn't a ritualistic uh confusion or ritualistic par. It was more of a geographical par. If for example I like to be very prepared. I like riding motorcycles. I like riding bicycles. If I'm going on a trip, it benefits me to know how many kilometers, how many meters, how many hours I'm going to be on the road. So such information from here to here going to be a walk of this many meters. If these information were present, I think not just me, I live there, but anybody else also coming for the first time, they would be able to prepare mentally, you'll be able to prepare physically as well from beforehand.
Muhammad: I see.
Obaid: These information were very good as well.
Muhammad: I see. Makes sense. Uh in terms of exploration, right, when you first time went to Makka, uh the very first time and you were uh new there, how difficult was it to like find the right place for shopping, uh find the right place for food? Do you know exactly where to go from your uh local connection or you you have some difficulties then? Because I went with my family and my family consists of my spouse and three children which the youngest was three year old. We did not really have the opportunity or the luxury of walking a lot and speeding out where to go which is the best place to go. So we always ended up choosing whatever option was the closest and was the uh and required the less least amount of effort for us. So in that sense whatever was close to uh We went for that and we automatically found any hotel that was closest to him or that was affordable. Uh but we did not have the opportunity or source of information to know okay this restaurant is this restaurant this cuisine this restaurant offers this cuine so and so that was a big for this information because I will tell you what is the biggest challenges of finding all sadly a linguistic challenge.
Muhammad: Uh your voice is coming a bit muffled. So if you can maybe clear it up
Obaid: sure the internet connection. What I was saying is one of the biggest challenge Saudi Arabia particularly is a linguistic challenge. So even if you Google information for example which all we are offers the average prices of them you will find a barrier a language barrier that information is presented to you in Arabic. and you're not not all the web of these uh restaurants or hotels offer a transition English or an accurate transmission. So there's business here as well. I think this is a this is a good market to tap into or service to offer um to get an idea to where things generally are, what is closest to them and what are they looking for and what are the average prices of things to eat. Uh shop to go to buy certain certain commodities, certain souvenirs if there was a possibility finding this information particularly in Mish I think we would have benefited more.
Muhammad: I see. I see. Do you feel the same thing for uh like Zara? So when you for example going to Javalma or Javalur many people they went there by themsel by looking into taking a taxi or Google map. But the sometimes taxi driver they're not able to explain that. So do you think if there is an app when you go into near certain area, it has an audio activated panel that you can listen to and it tell you significance of that area. Do you think something like that would help as well?
Obaid: Oh, that would be amazing. Yes, I'm glad you brought up this topic. So, most people that do and that they're not going through the travel operators or Hajumbla operators, they are left to uh find out the mission. the drivers uh I'm not saying they're less less aware they're very much aware but they will always because they're good people these drivers these uh they tell you that this is what I know this is what I have heard from somebody I cannot guarantee the authenticity of the information but this is what I've heard this is what I know u so there is no authenticity in terms of yes this is what the local government um approves that this is the right information. I'll give you an example of Madina. There was always this well in Madina that people said used to belong to Salman.
Muhammad: Yes.
Obaid: But still today I have not seen any signage that the government put up affirming this but it's just just hearsay.
Muhammad: Yes.
Obaid: Yes. I I I exactly understand how I I share my experience as well. I was there is a very famous well um near um uh Majidal Kuba um I I was looking for it but I don't know the exact location or in the map and there is no way I can find it but I saw in YouTube video it's maybe half an hour walking distance from there or maybe half an like 10-minute taxi but because I don't know and I was not able to explain in Arabic to the driver I was not able to go but I really wanted to go because I think this is one of the life well there and like one of the guide there showed me a closed well. So there's there's this place where's like like ring was dropped I like that well was shown to me and there is a marking there only right but I heard there's also a live well uh so I think this gives things value in my opinion and I'm glad that you also agree with that so I think um
Obaid: and uh you also you also mentioned that having uh audios or lectures from uh accredited
Muhammad: fewers that give an example or that tell you or provide information about certain things that you're going to that is that is an amazing that is going to be a game changer.
Muhammad: Yeah. So I will we are also um coming to the very last part of the interview. I have two more questions only. First of all uh you come with your family uh so you have young kids there. So share maybe some of the challenge you face uh with your family by yourself uh that you think that you think can be solved using technology right so share some of the uh maybe top five challenges you face and
Obaid: is it is it particularly about uh Haj and Umra or about living in now living there
Muhammad: no like Haj and Umra and logistics surrounding it
Obaid: um like I said Uber is not a that you can avail in Makkah. You can I I I wasn't able to um I didn't even look at Uber because of the different roads being closed particularly during the times of salah. The roads are closed and at a very large radius. So if you have young children and if you have to walk quite a bit and if you're not mentally prepared for it and if you don't know about it, it's a big challenge. So in that logistics, uh if you are able to know beforehand that these are the short walking paths you can take to go for salah that must haram that would be easy that would be convenient and at the same time uh one of the things that I faced was not knowing the best possible buy things that a family with young children or with children might need. For example, I was really unprepared for my three-year-old and I as unprepared that I didn't have a a satchel to carry him in that the baby car that you can put around your chest you can carry him while doing salaf or anywhere else or doing so I just wanted to buy that from that location I searched in Madina I couldn't find it I had to make the trip I reach Maka I was trying to find it there were many stores there but none of them really had that baby carrier and everybody was pointing towards okay so if you think there's a chance of it then we might only like car and we had to lock quite a lot to go the car for go up escalators and at the end we also have found out that they don't have this. So basic necessities like okay the best place to buy baby food or the best place to buy these these carry off baby wipes to diapers closest to you from this hotel location it's based on that all of these information is highly beneficial in terms of the logistics and if somebody wishes to really this is my opinion if somebody to travel to Makkah and Medina or in between the two cities and they want to travel in a way that doesn't physically tire them and it's not too fatiguing then the my my best recommendation is to use the Saudi government the hypers speed way because it takes you in half the time than a car or a bus. So if somebody put that into their budget that I'm going to go to Madina from Paka I'll take the train or I'm going to go from Madina to from Maka to Madina I'm going to take the train and this is my budget. being aware about the expense of the train service and what benefits it has uh as opposed to no I would like to take multiple stops I need a car. So be able to find both of these options presented to you and being able to make a choice will also help in the logistical situation for people who are going for abroad who do not live there uh that would really benefit them and in terms of food as well. I know different countries, different people have different cuisines and different tastes but sometimes when it's physical journey when it's is grueling to an extent you do not want to consume maybe deep fried foods or foods with a lot of spice and things like that. So knowing or being recommended from the medical professionals, dieticians or people who have gone there before that regardless of which culture you come from or whatever diet you may have these are the foods that you should prefer to consume and these are where you can get them from if you're going to be staying there for a few days or at least you have completed your house or your homework uh that would also be a very nice touch with whatever app or service that can be right
Muhammad: okay I think thank you very much for this recommendation um in terms of the worship itself Right. When you are doing tawa for sale, do you think like having an offline app where you have all of your duas that you want to make, having all the rituals uh like all the steps, do you think in a in a mobile app uh where all of these things is there would help or you prefer like a pen and pencil uh more like traditional way?
Obaid: 100% not a pen and pencil way. Uh given the Saudi government has paid most things to be used by app right now. To give you an example, the not app itself, people having to make appointments for Omra, for auda visits, all of that is now done through the notebook app. So the shift has already happened to the digital tools other than pen and paper. Um so yes, an app or something digital is is 100% more beneficial, not pen and paper.
Muhammad: Okay. And after right sometimes People says okay alhamdulillah they did Omrah their spirit was high but when they comes into family they work they kind of lost the spirit. So do you think have like a guided coaching program through a mobile app uh 6 month for 6 month after you perform your umbra or three per month perform your omra to have some solid habit into your life. Do you think that something like that would add values to you?
Obaid: It would certainly add value but uh from my exp in psychology because of being in the training uh people because of customer service training because of teaching I'm a teacher I'm a mentor so I really don't think that is that a six month program like that is going to be by most people rather if somebody who has finished their Omra and they're returning to their home country if they could be reminded through daily or weekly notifications about their experience of their home. It could be given some sort of memory milestones. For example, you're aware about how meta does this. Meta automatically after a year reminds you of pictures that you have posted or taken year back. Even your Android devices and your uh Apple device got a new phone with photos in it. It'll remind you a year later. Oh, this is a throwback to the last year on the same date. These things have a sentimental value. So rather than giving them a program or coaching or a guide for a certain number of months you follow as to how to live your life post um it's it's 100% it's idealistic but people don't live by the ideals neither do I really really easy easy transition if people can be reminded about their experience uh reminded of that they have gone to Seattle visits and you know it has aal reminder emotional uh imp impact on them. So that will fuel them further uh to do a little bit more reading. Maybe we can provide extra articles, maybe align them over certain verses or hadith. Nothing too glory, nothing that requires a lot of commitment off the bat. Something that is based on the sentiment or the emotions of having been there.
Muhammad: I see. Okay. Makes sense. Makes sense. Uh so for example we have discussed uh lots of the ideas and we brainstorm together like so it so think if so if I say like uh if there's one part of that where you can shop around and buy various things like transportation hotel accommodation that is there on the other hand there's more like a guiding aspect so a digital guide that will tell you where the shops are where the food court are where to go for uh ziara right uh maybe some aspect of how to perform UMRA and all of those things like the guidance part of that. Would you be comfortable paying for an onetime fee for an app? Uh if you get a guidance during Umrah?
Obaid: Yes, of course. It depends on how much it costs. But of course, yes.
Muhammad: So, how much price you think would be fair uh for this uh kind of app that will give you Omrah and Omrah and during Hajj also Hajj guidance like tell you like some of the places that you can or tell you regarding like the geography and give you some tips and tricks uh regarding logistics and also help you with your um ritual itself remind you what are the right steps to take authentic duas that you need to make and a tool for you how to make duas and stuff uh kind of bigger bigger uh fees so I'm just a teacher I don't earn as much so for me whatever you're asking me might not be high amount, but as it is a bomb and if it is an app that gives me lifetime service and something that it's not going to just cancel or go down and stop updating over the years, but I can use this app again and again to go for my Oprah trips. I would be more than comfortable to spend anywhere between $25 to $50 depending on the range of services it offers.
Muhammad: I see $25. And if it gives you like one year one year limit, so think of that within one year you can do as much as Omra as you want but it's going to be like a one year's subscription. So for if it ask you only to pay for one year uh and do you think for one year $15 or $20 would be fair or do you think that's too much? Then
Obaid: if it is a oneear subscription fee then certainly I would be okay between the range of uh $10 to $20
Muhammad: $10 to $20. Okay. Makes sense. Makes sense. Okay. Uh Thank you very much uh brother Oat. It has been really wonderful and insightful talk with you. I'm really grateful uh for your time and hope to speak with you soon. Inshallah whatever endeavors you are jumping on to may Allah give you the also in remember us in your duasam.</p>
<h3 id="interview-notes">Interview Notes:</h3>
<p>Background Information
Abu Yusuf Obaidur Rahman is in the 35-45 age group and is a current resident of Canada. He has performed Umrah five times, all within a concentrated period between August and December of the previous year. During these pilgrimages, he was living in Madina and working as a teacher.
Journey / Context
Obaidur Rahman's Umrah trips were primarily self-organised because he was a resident of Madina, making it very easy for him to arrange his own transportation and accommodation. He relied heavily on "peer reviews" from other long-time residents or citizens of Madina for recommendations on hotels and transportation (e.g., bus or taxi stops).
On one occasion, he travelled with co-workers on a "luxurious bus" that was organised and paid for by anonymous sponsors, where the pilgrim groups never knew the sponsor or the cost. Other times, his transport options included driving with a friend or using public transport from private rental companies that offered "Bombi". He also used public taxi spots with co-workers.
During his trips, he travelled with his family, including his spouse and three children, the youngest of whom was three years old.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Transportation Issues:
    ◦ Many pilgrims, particularly foreigners, perceive taxi companies as engaging in "extortion" due to high prices, especially for travel within Makkah and Madina, and for intercity travel. Obaidur Rahman, as a local, did not face this issue as a "rampant regularity" because he knew the reasonable prices and was able to bargain effectively.
    ◦ The unmarked and unregistered private taxi vehicles (which operate without official Uber/Kareem signs but offer chauffeur services) pose a reliability and safety challenge for foreign pilgrims, who might worry about being taken to wrong or "weird areas".
    ◦ While Uber and Kareem operate in Madina, they are "somewhat already doing that" for local travel, they are not available in Makkah or for intercity transport. Furthermore, Uber and Kareem are perceived to be more expensive than what a local taxi driver would charge.
    ◦ Road closures, particularly during Salah times, in Makkah and Madina, create significant logistical challenges, especially for families with young children, requiring long and unexpected walks if pilgrims are not prepared or aware of the alternative routes.
• Accommodation Issues:
    ◦ A significant complaint is the discrepancy between advertised hotel star ratings (e.g., two, three, four-star) and the actual quality of service, which is often "really bad".
    ◦ Pilgrims frequently encounter booking issues, such as hotels having no reservation found or being overbooked upon arrival, leading to considerable "hassle for foreigner[s]".
    ◦ To mitigate these issues, foreigners often "spend a lot of money and go to these hotels that are renowned with these booking issues" as a safer option, as they lack the opportunity to "shop around" like locals.
    ◦ A "pyramid scheme" in hotel booking, where properties are sold through multiple intermediaries, leads to prices becoming "like 50% more than what the hotel owner get paid".
• Geographical, Logistical, and Information Gaps:
    ◦ Geographical confusion during rituals, such as knowing "exactly which door to enter from," "which way to turn," and identifying the "most convenient" washrooms for performing Sa'i.
    ◦ A lack of detailed geographical information (e.g., distances in kilometers or meters for walks) prevents pilgrims from mentally and physically preparing for their journeys.
    ◦ Difficulty in finding suitable shopping and food places, especially for families with young children, often results in choosing the closest and least effort-intensive options rather than optimal ones.
    ◦ The "biggest challenge Saudi Arabia particularly is a linguistic challenge". Essential information, such as average restaurant prices or locations for specific commodities and souvenirs, is predominantly in Arabic, with inadequate or inaccurate English translations online.
    ◦ The authenticity of information regarding historical and religious sites is a concern. Local drivers or guides often provide information based on hearsay rather than official or "accredited" sources, leading to unverified claims (e.g., about specific wells) due to a lack of government signage.
    ◦ Challenges in locating basic necessities for families with young children, such as baby carriers, baby food, wipes, or diapers, often requiring extensive and fruitless searches.
• Post-Pilgrimage Spiritual Maintenance:
    ◦ Pilgrims often experience a decline in their spiritual high after returning home and resuming daily routines.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Enhanced Digital Platforms for Convenience and Transparency:
    ◦ Transportation App: An "amazing platform" where taxi drivers and public transport companies could post their charges, allowing customers to easily find the right price for their trips.
    ◦ Reliability App for Private Taxis: A new app providing "a little bit of reliability" for private taxis would be a "game changer" by addressing safety concerns for foreigners.
    ◦ Direct Hotel Booking Platform: A platform where hotel owners could directly advertise and communicate with customers (B2C) would "certainly reduce the hassle" and potentially lower prices by eliminating intermediaries. Hotel owners would likely embrace such a "shortcut" if it ensures the "least amount of cash" hassle.
• Comprehensive Digital Guidance and Information:
    ◦ Geographical and Logistical Guide: An app or service that provides precise geographical information (e.g., "walk of this many meters" between points) to help pilgrims prepare mentally and physically.
    ◦ Food and Shopping Guide: Information on the best places for food and shopping, including average prices and cuisines, particularly in English, would greatly benefit pilgrims.
    ◦ Audio-Activated Panel for Ziara (Visiting Historical Sites): An app with an audio-activated panel near significant areas that explains their historical and religious importance would be "amazing" and a "game changer", providing "accredited" information to pilgrims not using tour operators.
    ◦ Family Logistics Support: Information on the best places to buy baby necessities (food, wipes, diapers, carriers) closest to the pilgrim's accommodation.
    ◦ Dietary Recommendations: Suggestions from medical professionals or dieticians on suitable foods (e.g., avoiding deep-fried or spicy options) and where to find them, considering the physical demands of the pilgrimage.
    ◦ Offline Ritual App: An offline mobile app containing all necessary duas and ritual steps, alongside authentic information, would be "100% more beneficial" than traditional pen and paper, aligning with the Saudi government's shift towards digital tools (e.g., Nusuk app).
• Post-Pilgrimage Spiritual Reminders:
    ◦ Instead of lengthy coaching programs, daily or weekly notifications that serve as "memory milestones" (similar to Meta or phone photo throwbacks) could remind pilgrims of their Umrah experience. This approach, based on "sentiment or the emotions of having been there," would have an "emotional impact" and fuel continued spiritual engagement through reminders, articles, verses, or hadith, without requiring significant commitment.
• App Monetisation and Pricing:
    ◦ Obaidur Rahman would be "comfortable paying" for a "one-stop shop" app that offers convenience and comparable prices to self-arrangement.
    ◦ For a lifetime service app providing comprehensive Hajj/Umrah guidance (geography, logistics tips, rituals, duas), he would be willing to pay between $25 and $50 USD, depending on the range of services offered.
    ◦ For a one-year subscription, a price range of $10 to $20 USD would be considered fair.
• Regulatory Environment:
    ◦ The "biggest issue" for foreign companies seeking to operate in Saudi Arabia is the "language barrier" when communicating with government officials responsible for regulations.
    ◦ However, the Saudi government has a "big motivation" to support the tech sector as part of its "Vision 2030". A well-pitched tech idea that is "feasible" and "beneficial for pilgrims" and the "local population" would likely find government support.

Other Observations
• The interview was conducted and transcribed entirely in English.
• Obaidur Rahman's demanding job in Madina limited his ability to extensively explore industry regulations or connections.
• There is a general human preference for "convenience" and "one-stop shops," influencing the adoption of services like those offered by Walmart and fast-food companies.
• He highlighted the effectiveness of sentimental "memory milestones" in consumer technology, such as photo throwbacks on Meta, Android, and Apple devices, as a model for post-pilgrimage spiritual engagement.</p>
