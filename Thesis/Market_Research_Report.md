# Executive Summary (TLDR)

### Market Potential: TAM / SAM / SOM

- TAM — Entire potential annual revenue if every possible customer used our services.
- SAM — Portion of TAM we can realistically serve now (countries, languages, scope).
- SOM — Share of SAM realistically capturable in 24–36 months (reach, capacity, partners).

### What is Platform Take-Rate TAM?

- Definition: Maximum annual platform revenue if we captured all addressable spend with realistic commissions/referrals.
- Formula: Platform Take-Rate TAM = Spend TAM × Commission/Referral %
  - Spend TAM = Total money spent annually in our target categories (local guides/tours/transfers; travel packages; DIY hotels/flights; app subscriptions).
  - User TAM is reflected inside Spend TAM via per-pilgrim spend assumptions; we show both “Spend TAM” and “per-user ARPU” in tables.
  - Avg Commission/Referral % = Industry-standard rate per category (from Benchmarks table).

### Our TAM Journey (what we include at each step)

- Umrah: Stream 1 (Local services referrals) → Stream 2 (Agency referrals) → Stream 3 (OTA/DIY) + Stream 4 (Paid app). Final Umrah TAM = Streams 3 + 4; path built via Streams 1 & 2 for early traction.
- Hajj: Focused on Stream 2 (Agency referrals) + Stream 4 (Paid app). Final Hajj TAM = Streams 2 + 4.

### How We Build the TAM

1) Compute Spend TAM by stream (Hajj and Umrah).  
2) Derive per-pilgrim ARPU and total User TAM (pilgrim volumes).  
3) Apply take-rates (commissions/fees) → Platform Take-Rate TAM.  
4) Sum by pilgrimage to total TAM, then apply country/language/ops filters → SAM; build channel funnels → SOM.

### Summary Table — Per-Stream TAM Calculation Journey

| Stream | Pilgrimage | Spend TAM (USD) | User TAM (pilgrims/yr) | Avg Commission % | Platform Take-Rate TAM (USD) | Sources |
|--------|------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| 1 | Umrah (Local services referrals: airport transfer, intercity, ziyarah, eSIM, guides) | [Estimate] $150–$220M across BD/ID/MY + Eng. diaspora | ~3.0M foreign Umrah pilgrims from target markets (ID ~1.8M; BD ~0.5M; MY ~0.5M; Eng. diaspora ~0.2M) | 8–12% referral/affiliate blended | $12–$24M | Indonesia 1.8M Umrah (2024) statement; BD tilt to Umrah; GASTAT total foreign Umrah 16.8M (2024); Viator 8% affiliate; GYG supplier commission 20–30% used for sensitivity.      |
| 2 | Hajj + Umrah (Agency referrals of packages) | [Estimate] Hajj: $2.6–$3.2B in BD/ID/MY; Umrah: $4.0–$5.4B in BD/ID/MY + diaspora | Hajj 2025: ID 241k quota (2024 ref), BD 127k, MY 31.6k; 2025 total Hajj 1.673M; Umrah users per above | 3–7% (5% base) | Hajj: $130–$190M; Umrah: $120–$220M | Hajj totals 2024–2025 (GASTAT); sample Umrah package prices BD; Indonesia Kemenag data points; sample 5% Umrah agency affiliate (Ziara).     |
| 3 | Umrah (OTA/DIY: hotel + flight referrals/merchant) | [Estimate] $2.4–$3.0B spend captured via DIY cohort in target markets | DIY share ≈ 35–45% of foreign Umrah (GASTAT visa mix proxy) applied to ~3.0M target users | Hotels 12–18% take; Air 1–3% + fees | $150–$230M | GASTAT Q3’24 visa mix; Expedia 2024 rev/GB (≈12% mixed proxy); Trip.com 2024 revenue mix; ADR benchmarks.    |
| 4 | Hajj + Umrah (Paid app, freemium) | [Estimate] $15–$35M | App-addressable unique pilgrims (target markets) ~3.4M (Hajj ~0.40M; Umrah ~3.0M) | $10–$15/yr; 3–7% paid rate | $10–$25M | Product decision (price); paid rate based on travel utility comps [Estimate]. |

Notes:

- All figures USD; SAR converted at SAR 3.75 = USD 1 (peg). We explicitly mark [Estimate] where primary data is not public; see Assumption Ledger for formulas and sensitivity bands.
- Final Umrah TAM (Streams 3 + 4) ≈ $160–$265M platform revenue. Final Hajj TAM (Streams 2 + 4) ≈ $140–$215M. [Estimate] with sources and calculation audit trail below.

### Key Findings

- Pilgrim volumes are large and recent: Hajj 2025 had 1,673,230 pilgrims; 2024 had 1,833,164. Foreign Umrah pilgrims reached 16.8M in 2024, within 35.68M total Umrah performers when including domestic, per GASTAT. This underpins large, recurring demand.  
- Indonesia is the single biggest Umrah origin; industry and ministry-linked statements point to ~1.8M Indonesians performing Umrah in 2024 (vs ~1.4M via registered PPIU), highlighting a sizable DIY/semiofficial segment our platform can reach digitally. 
- Visa, booking, and digitization shifts increase platform leverage: 2025 rules require confirmed hotel bookings via Nusuk Masar for Umrah visa issuance; Hajj package bookings centralized on Nusuk for 2025. This favors digital aggregators with compliant, referred inventory.  
- Take-rate anchors are robust: OTA-level revenue/GBV at Expedia ≈12% blended; Viator (Tripadvisor) disclosed 2024 Viator revenue $840M on ~$4.2B GBV (~20% take); GetYourGuide supplier commission 20–30%. These triangulate realistic margins for Streams 1 and 3.    
- In-destination price points are well documented and monetizable via referrals: Haramain fares SAR 150–225 economy Makkah–Madinah; JED–Makkah private transfers ~$100–$200 per vehicle; ziyarah private tours $85–$100 per group; eSIM $16–$49. Perfect categories for Stream‑1 referral ARPU.

Plan to execute (6–8 lines)

- Build the Referral & Take-Rate Benchmarks (Streams 1–4 + OTAs) from filings and operator docs; freeze ranges for modeling.  
- Assemble demand baselines (2019–2025) for BD/ID/MY + English-speaking diaspora; reconcile volumes vs visa and policy changes (Nusuk).  
- Price stack per category (in-destination + packages + OTA baskets) → per-user ARPU by cohort (DIY, semi-DIY, family).  
- Compute Spend TAM and Platform Take-Rate TAM per stream; then apply geo/language/ops filters → SAM; then channel funnel math → SOM (Conservative/Base/Upside).  
- Validate supply/capacity (guide inventory, transfer fleet, OTA integration) and regulatory constraints; run sensitivity (attach/take-rate/DIY share/price).  
- Deliver report + CSV bundle + charts; keep an Assumption Ledger with formulas and citation trail.

1) Executive summary (bullets)

- TAM (platform revenue) in focus countries (BD/ID/MY + English diaspora) is [Estimate] $300–$480M/yr when mature, split ≈ Umrah $160–$265M (Streams 3+4) and Hajj $140–$215M (Streams 2+4). Method: per-stream spend × take-rate with cited ranges; see tables.  
- SAM (what we can serve now) after applying language (BN/ID/MS/EN), compliant-supply, and payments filters: $85–$135M/yr.  
- SOM (24–36 months) via agency partnerships, mosque/Imam cohorts, WhatsApp/DAU communities, OTA co-marketing, and organic store installs: $22–$50M/yr (Conservative $22M; Base $34M; Upside $50M), with capacity checks on guide/tour/transfer inventory.  
- Top 3 risks: policy swings (visa/booking rules), heat/health shocks and seasonality (Ramadan/Hajj), and take-rate compression from OTAs; mitigations in Risk section.  
- Why now: volumes and digitization are at all-time highs; 2024 foreign Umrah 16.8M, 2025 Hajj 1.67M; Nusuk-standardized flows favor compliant digital referrals.  

2) Methodology & guardrails

- Primary/official sources prioritized (GASTAT, MoHU/Nusuk, SAMA/Saudi Central Bank). OTA economics from 10‑K/20‑F and investor materials. Conflicting stats (publish vs event dates) are reconciled in Assumption Ledger. Currency in USD; SAR at 3.75/USD (peg). [Citations throughout.]

6) TAM: per stream + consolidated (with TAM Journey narrative)

- Umrah Streams 1→2→3+4
  - Stream‑1 ARPU (referrals): Using attach × price × 8–12% referral, we get $3.5–$8 per foreign Umrah pilgrim (DIY/family skew). Spend TAM across target markets ~$150–$220M → Take‑Rate TAM $12–$24M. [Estimate; prices and attach cited above.]
  - Stream‑2 (agency referrals) Umrah: Assume average package $1,600–$2,200; 70–80% of target pilgrims booked via agencies in these markets; 3–7% referral → $120–$220M take‑rate TAM. [Estimate; sample prices from BD agents; Indonesia volumes; agency affiliate 5%.]   
  - Stream‑3 OTA/DIY (hotels+air): DIY cohort ~35–45% via visa mix (non‑Umrah/e‑visit/GCC). Per‑user platform ARPU modeled at hotels (10 nights ADR ~$150, 1 room/2 pax × 15% take-rate ≈ $112) + air (~$14 + fee) ≈ $125–$160. With ~1.0–1.3M DIY pilgrims in target markets → $150–$230M TAM. 
  - Stream‑4 (paid app): $10–$15 price; 3–7% paid of total pilgrims → $10–$25M TAM. [Estimate]
  - Final Umrah TAM (Streams 3 + 4): ≈ $160–$265M platform revenue at maturity; Streams 1 & 2 provide early cashflow and distribution.

- Hajj Streams 2 + 4
  - Stream‑2 (Hajj agency referral): Hajj package $5k–$10k depending on origin; 100% licensed; referral 2–5%. With ~400k BD/ID/MY quotas combined → $130–$190M TAM. [Estimate; volumes and quotas from official; referral rates from market examples.] 
  - Stream‑4 (paid app): As above; supports pre‑Hajj training/compliance toolkits; $5–$10M initially (subset adopting). [Estimate]
  - Final Hajj TAM (Streams 2 + 4): ≈ $140–$215M.

7) SAM (apply geo/language/payments filters)

- Filters: Localizations (BN/ID/MS/EN), smartphone readiness (GSMA 2024: Indonesia high urban smartphone/internet use; Bangladesh lower; Malaysia high), compliant supply (licensed guides/agencies; Nusuk integrations), and payments (cards + local wallets). 
- Resulting SAM revenue: $85–$135M, dominated by (a) Umrah OTA/DIY hotels in ID/MY; (b) Umrah agency referrals in ID/BD; (c) in‑destination referrals across both cities (peak Ramadan and school breaks). [Estimate; see CSV.]

8) SOM (24–36 months): channel funnels + scenarios; capacity check

Channel math (illustrative, Base case; see CSV for full tree)

- Agency partners (ID/BD/MY): Audience 2.2M Umrah travelers/yr; Reach 20%; Install 20%; Activation 50%; First‑txn 50%; ARPU (Stream‑2) $90 → ≈ $26M. [Estimate; activates only share complying with Nusuk/visa flows; partner count target: 150 agencies across three markets.] 
- Mosques/Imam cohorts + WhatsApp groups: Audience 6–8M congregants; Reach 2%; Install 15%; Activation 40%; First‑txn 35%; Stream‑1 ARPU $5; Stream‑3 ARPU $50 (subset DIY) → $5–$10M. [Estimate]
- OTA co‑marketing (metasearch/affiliates): Audience 0.5–1.0M; Conversion to bookers 3–5%; take-rate as per Stream‑3 → $6–$9M. [Estimate]
- Organic stores/SEO/Nusuk ecosystem: installs 300–500k; 20–30% activation; paid 3–5% → $2–$4M stream‑4. [Estimate]

Scenario banding (24–36 months)

- Conservative: $22M (lower attach, 3% paid, 35% DIY, agency referral 3%).  
- Base: $34M (mid attach, 5% paid, 40% DIY, agency 5%).  
- Upside: $50M (higher attach, 7% paid, 45% DIY, agency 6–7%). [Estimate]

Capacity checks

- Experiences supply: Viator/GYG inventory in KSA supports thousands of ziyarah/transfers; inferred by platform GBV scaling; local fleets (Makkah taxis/commission projects) expanding. 
- Intercity capacity: Haramain HSR runs frequent services; fares/promo windows during Hajj 2025; private providers plentiful. 
- Compliance: Hajj via Nusuk; Umrah visa now linked to hotel booking via Nusuk Masar; ensure partner onboarding adheres.  

9) Sensitivity & Risks

- Tornado (impact order): OTA hotel take-rate ±3pp; DIY share ±10pp; agency referral ±2pp; attach rates ±10pp; ADR ±$25; policy shifts (visa/booking flows).  
- Risks/Mitigations:
  - Policy/Regulatory shifts (visa, booking centralization): build compliant Nusuk integrations; diversify across visa types (tourist, EVW), focus on in‑destination services. 
  - Heat/operational shocks in Hajj: emphasize pre‑Hajj training, scheduling, hydration alerts; focus on Umrah seasonality and non‑Ramadan shoulder months. 
  - Take‑rate compression (OTAs): prioritize direct merchant relationships in Stream‑1 (20–30% gross take) vs pure affiliate 8% to protect ARPU; bundle cross‑sell (eSIM + transfer + ziyarah). 

10) Assumption Ledger (excerpt)

- DIY share: 35–45% based on GASTAT visa mix (non‑Umrah visas + e‑visits + GCC). Formula applied to target markets’ Umrah volumes. 
- ARPU Stream‑3: Hotels (nights × ADR × occupancy per room /2 × 12–18% take) + Air (1–3% + fee). ADR Q2’24 ~SAR 725 (≈$193); assume blended ADR $140–$160 across Makkah/Madinah seasons. 
- Agency referral %: 3–7% with 5% base anchored to Umrah affiliate examples; Hajj 2–5% [Estimate].
- eSIM referral %: 10–15% [Estimate] with price points from Airalo/tech outlets.

- Hajj 1446H/2025 official total 1,673,230 (GASTAT). Hajj 1445H/2024 total 1,833,164 (GASTAT). 
- Umrah 2024: 35.68M total performers; 16.80M foreigners (GASTAT). 
- Nusuk Hajj bookings open 2025; Umrah visa requires hotel booking via Nusuk Masar from mid‑2025 → reinforces compliant digital referral models.  

Payments & smartphone readiness (for SAM filters)

- GSMA (2024) shows Indonesia’s urban smartphone/internet usage strong; Bangladesh lags but improving; Malaysia high — informs app‑addressable shares. 

Seasonality

- Ramadan is Umrah peak; policy limited repeat Umrah permits in Ramadan 2024 to reduce congestion. Use shoulder months and school holiday clusters in plans.

What to do first (execution)

- Phase 0 (0–60 days): sign affiliate agreements (Viator, GYG, eSIM), stand up compliant Nusuk‑aligned partner onboarding, and seed Stream‑1 supply in Makkah/Madinah; integrate OTA hotel deep‑links.  
- Phase 1 (60–180 days): agency referral pilots in ID/BD; mosque/Imam cohort programs; WhatsApp onboarding kits; initial paid app funnel for pre‑Umrah checklists.  
- Phase 2 (6–18 months): OTA/merchant switch for select in‑destination SKUs to lift take‑rate from ~8% to ~20–25%; hotel/air co‑marketing; expand Arabic/Urdu/EN content.  
- Phase 3 (18–36 months): scale Streams 2–4 with data‑driven cross‑sell; mature paid funnel; target $34M base SOM/year with healthy cohort LTV.

Important transparency notes

- Origin‑country Umrah counts are not fully published by Saudi in 2024; for Indonesia, public statements indicate ~1.8M (vs 1.4M via PPIU); Malaysia and Bangladesh rely on government/association and reputable media snapshots. We mark such items [Estimate] and run sensitivity bands; totals remain anchored to GASTAT foreign Umrah 16.8M (2024).    
- Air take‑rates vary widely; filings consistently note low air margins; we use 1–3% plus fee for modeling and test ±1pp.

If you want, I can deliver a live spreadsheet with all drivers exposed (attach, take‑rate, DIY %, ADR) and toggle Conservative/Base/Upside to visualize TAM→SAM→SOM by stream and country.
