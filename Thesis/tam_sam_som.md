### Market Scope and Stream Definitions

The analysis segments monetisation opportunities into four discrete revenue streams, with explicit rules to prevent double counting:

| Stream | Description                                                | Umrah DIY | Umrah Agency | Hajj |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------: | -----------: | ---: |
| **S1** | Local services (e.g., rides, tours, eSIMs, equipment hire) |         ✔ |            ✖ |    ✖ |
| **S2** | Agency package referrals                                   |         ✖ |            ✔ |    ✔ |
| **S3** | Hotels and flights booked via an intermediary (OTA-like)   |         ✔ |            ✖ |    ✖ |
| **S4** | Paid application (US\$10 per unique user)                  |         ✔ |            ✔ |    ✔ |

**Rules applied:**

* S1 and S3 apply exclusively to **DIY Umrah** travellers
* S2 applies only to **agency** cohorts
* Hajj monetisation includes **S2 and S4 only**
* S4 is calculated on **unique users** (Umrah de-duplicated)

**Regulatory considerations:**
Hajj sales are conducted solely through authorised providers (e.g., the [Nusuk Hajj platform](https://hajj.nusuk.sa/)). The recommended market entry strategy is to prioritise S2 referrals and S4 digital products, followed by S1 local services, and finally S3 OTA services once licensing or partnerships are secured.

### Section 1 — Total Addressable Market (Global, 2024)

### Scenario Summary

| Scenario                                   |       Umrah | Hajj (S2+S4) |       Total |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------: | -----------: | ----------: |
| **Defensive**                              |   \$778.51M |    \$339.99M | \$1,118.50M |
| **VC-Balanced Base (headline)**            |   \$919.33M |    \$343.21M | \$1,262.54M |
| **Alternative Base (higher attach rates)** | \$1,095.80M |    \$354.50M | \$1,450.30M |
| **Aspirational**                           | \$1,039.38M |    \$354.49M | \$1,393.87M |

**Key modelling parameters:**

* **Hotel OTA take-rate**: 14.3% ([Booking Holdings FY2024 Form 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm))
* **Flight OTA take-rate**: 2% ([Expedia Group FY2024 results](https://www.expediagroup.com/investors/news-and-events/financial-releases/news/news-details/2025/Expedia-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx); lodging ≈80% of revenue, air ≈3%)
* **KSA hotel online penetration**: \~30%, with OTAs capturing most online share ([WebInTravel, 2024](https://www.webintravel.com/saudi-arabia-online-travel-agency-ota-market-skyrockets-ota-air-gbv-hits-us1-9-billion-hotel-climbs-to-2-3-billion/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Formula overview:**

* **S3** (Umrah DIY): (ADR × Length of Stay × take-rate × hotel attach %) + (Return fare × take-rate × flight attach %)
* **S1** (Umrah DIY): Σ(attach × price × commission) for each local service category
* **S2** (Umrah Agency/Hajj): number of pilgrims × package price × referral %
* **S4** (Umrah/Hajj): unique users × US\$10 × adoption rate

### Section 2 — Serviceable Addressable Market (Current Scope)

**Geographic focus:** Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia
**Revenue streams included:** S2 (agency referrals) and S4 (paid application) only

**Hajj quotas (2024):**

* **Indonesia:** 241,000 ([Antara News](https://en.antaranews.com/news/302688/indonesia-to-send-241000-people-to-this-years-hajj-pilgrimage?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Malaysia:** 31,600 ([The Malaysian Reserve](https://themalaysianreserve.com/2024/06/14/31600-malaysian-hajj-pilgrims-start-moving-to-arafah/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Bangladesh:** 127,198 ([The Financial Express](https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/last-page/127198-can-perform-hajj-in-2024-1691000221?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### SAM — 2024 Base (\$M, rounded to \$0.01M)

| Country    |  Umrah S2 | Umrah S4 |   Hajj S2 |  Hajj S4 |      Total |
| ---------- | --------: | -------: | --------: | -------: | ---------: |
| Indonesia  |     43.20 |     6.88 |     50.61 |     0.72 |     101.42 |
| Malaysia   |      8.00 |     1.70 |      6.64 |     0.11 |      16.45 |
| Bangladesh |      6.00 |     0.59 |     26.71 |     0.32 |      33.62 |
| **Total**  | **57.20** | **9.18** | **83.96** | **1.15** | **151.49** |

**Sensitivity analysis (Umrah origin counts):**

* Low case: \$136.29M
* Base case: \$151.49M
* High case: \$161.13M

Hajj components are quota-anchored; Umrah origin counts are derived from multiple government and industry sources, hence the use of a range.

### Section 3 — Serviceable Obtainable Market (12-Month Horizon)

**Target capture rates:**

* Umrah S2: Indonesia 0.6%, Malaysia 1.0%, Bangladesh 0.3% of agency cohorts
* Hajj S2: 0.8% of each country’s pilgrims
* S4: 12.5% of each country’s adoption ceiling in year one

**Capacity constraints:**
Hajj referrals limited to 5,000 seats/year (current targets do not exceed this threshold)

### SOM — 12-Month Target (\$M; users rounded to nearest 100)

| Country    | Umrah S2 (\$M) |     Users | Umrah S4 (\$M) |      Payers | Hajj S2 (\$M) |     Seats | Hajj S4 (\$M) |     Payers | Total (\$M) |
| ---------- | -------------: | --------: | -------------: | ----------: | ------------: | --------: | ------------: | ---------: | ----------: |
| Indonesia  |           0.26 |     6,500 |           0.86 |      86,100 |          0.40 |     1,900 |          0.09 |      9,000 |        1.62 |

### Section 4 — Key Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Regulatory framework for Hajj:** All bookings and visas are processed via authorised platforms such as [Nusuk](https://hajj.nusuk.sa/).
   *Mitigation:* Operate as a referral, education, and comparison layer aligned with authorised providers.

2. **Licensing requirements for OTA operations in KSA:** Selling travel services requires a Travel & Tourism Services licence from the Ministry of Tourism, or an arrangement with a licensed partner.
   *Mitigation:* Secure licensing or partner agreements before launching S3.

3. **Data variability in Umrah origin counts:** No single centralised source for by-origin data.
   *Mitigation:* Maintain low/base/high scenarios in SAM and cite primary government or industry sources.

4. **Uncertain attach and adoption rates:** OTA attach rates and paid-app adoption vary by market.
   *Mitigation:* Use conservative, evidence-based assumptions and adjust as product analytics become available.

### Appendix A — Methodology and Formulae

**Currency and rounding:** All figures in USD; revenues rounded to \$0.01M; user counts to nearest 100.

**Key calculations:**

* S3 (DIY): (ADR × LoS × 14.3% × hotel attach) + (return fare × 2% × flight attach)
* S1 (DIY): Σ(attach × price × commission) across each local service type
* S2: (number of pilgrims × package price × referral %)
* S4: (unique users × \$10 × adoption rate)

**Double-count prevention:** S1/S3 limited to DIY Umrah; S2 limited to agency cohorts; Hajj includes only S2 and S4; S4 applied once per unique user.
