GOALS

Make traction, governance, and market math precise and consistent.

Fix typos, dangling formatting, rounding, headers, and link hygiene.

Standardize terminology (CAC vs CPI, in-destination, etc.).

Do not restructure the narrative beyond simple insertions/replacements listed here.

EDIT RULES (DO ALL)

Executive Summary — Traction wording

Find the sentence containing: 91 organic installs at $0.87 blended Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Replace exactly with:
91 total installs (51 organic) with blended **CPI** ≈ **$0.87** and paid **CPI** ≈ **$1.48**.
(Note: use CPI, not CAC.)

Executive Summary — Governance status

Find: secured a governance partnership with Taibah Institute

Replace with: a governance partnership (MoU) in progress with Taibah Institute
(If you also mention Taibah elsewhere as “secured” or “partnership”, change to “MoU in progress” for consistency unless a later section explicitly states it’s executed.)

S3 hotel take-rate consistency

Throughout Section 7 and Appendices where you list modeling inputs for S3, change the hotel take-rate to 14.0% (not 14.3%) in text and tables only so it matches the already-calculated Base totals.

Do not change any dollar totals in tables that are already computed; this step is to align the labeled percentage with existing totals.

Rounding harmonization

Where SAM is shown as 151.48 vs 151.49, normalize to $151.49M everywhere.

Where SOM is shown as 2.33 vs 2.32, normalize to $2.32M everywhere.

Add a small note once in Section 7: *Displayed values may differ by ±$0.01M due to rounding.* if not already present.

Evaluation Scores block (SECTION 1)

In the “Evaluation Scores” list, remove standalone numeric ratings if not all categories have them. Specifically, remove Market Timing: 9/10 there to avoid a partial-scored block. Keep the descriptive bullets.

NPS targets alignment (labels, not numbers)

Keep NPS ≥30 for v1/MVP gates (Success Metrics table in Section 8 and any “Ship public beta only if…” gate).

Keep Trip NPS ≥40 where you describe December success or “Go (scale…)” post-beta.

Add clarifying labels if missing, e.g., “(v1 gate)” next to NPS ≥30 and “(post-beta target)” next to Trip NPS ≥40.

Remove any stray NPS targets that contradict these two.

SOM table header clarity (Section 7)

In the SOM table, change the column header immediately to the right of Umrah S2 ($M) from Users to Referrals. Leave S4 columns labeled Payers.

Typos and formatting

Cresent Rating → CrescentRating

Heading **Competitive Differentiation** that currently renders with a dangling ** → make it Competitive Differentiation with normal bolding/heading as appropriate.

Fix duplicated phrase: change these are these are to these are.

In Appendix B, complete the truncated word commissio to commission.

Remove the duplicated KPI bullet block that reappears under “Out of Scope for This Cycle (Deferred)” (keep the first occurrence only).

Normalize capitalization: use lower-case we mid-sentence (not We), except at sentence starts and headings.

Standardize in-destination spelling with a hyphen everywhere.

License note up-front

In Executive Summary (end of the Guardrails/Why Now paragraph or as its own sentence), insert:
**Licensing note:** No direct Hajj sales; OTA-like flows (S3) will run only via licensed partners or post-licensure.

Use of funds (2 lines max)

In Executive Summary – The Ask, append a concise “Use of funds” clause at the end (keep to one sentence, no new numbers):
Use of funds: content governance & scholar reviews, offline Android reliability, concierge ops for liquidity tests, and trip-anchored analytics.

Link hygiene

Remove utm_source=chatgpt.com (and any ?utm_* query params) from links in Appendices and footnotes without changing the base URLs. Do not alter anchors or non-UTM parameters.

Currency/metrics labels

Ensure all $ figures use the $ prefix with no extra spaces (e.g., $1.48, not $ 1.48).

Ensure CPI is used only for install cost metrics; avoid calling it CAC anywhere unless it truly measures cost per paying customer.

Do not change numbers except where explicitly directed above.

No recalculation. No altering totals. Only labels/wording/rounding and the specific replacements described.
