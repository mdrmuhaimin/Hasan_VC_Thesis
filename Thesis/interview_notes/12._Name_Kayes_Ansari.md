Background Information
Name: Kaiyes Ansari

Age Group: 30–40

Pilgrimage Type: Umrah (4 times total)

Trip Types: 2 with an agency, 2 DIY

Travel Timing: Has traveled during Ramadan

Interviewer: Muhammad

Journey / Context
DIY Travel Preference:

Strong preference for DIY trips due to lower cost (about two-thirds of agency cost), greater flexibility, and avoidance of layered middlemen.

Used Booking.com for hotel bookings and found it far better than agency options.

No issues with visa arrangements.

Agency Experience:

Used a mid-sized Bangladeshi agency for two trips.

Felt services were overpriced, with multiple intermediaries before service delivery.

Ziyarat schedule was rigid and didn’t match his interests, so he skipped it entirely.

Lacked trust in agency’s guidance quality.

Local Transport & Logistics:

Madinah → Jeddah taxi required extensive haggling, with uncertainty over fair pricing.

General taxi experience was negative due to risk of scams.

Local Service Discovery:

Around the Haram, he felt lost on where to eat or shop.

No easy way to find trustworthy, good-value options.

Ritual Guidance:

Relied on a physical book and a free offline dua/ritual app.

Found this combination sufficient — no need for media-rich or always-online tools.

Pain Points / Challenges
Taxi pricing and trust issues caused stress and uncertainty.

Agency “pyramid” model felt exploitative.

Rigid Ziyarat schedule limited spiritual customization.

Poor discovery of local services led to missed good food and shopping.

No trusted all-in-one booking tool for Hajj & Umrah.

Opportunities / Suggestions
Hajj & Umrah Marketplace Platform:

Booking.com-style service with transparent pricing, verified providers, and standardized quality.

Improved Local Service Discovery:

Tools to find trustworthy restaurants, shops, and services near Haram.

Transport Coordination Features:

Pre-booked or vetted taxi services to avoid scams.

Offline-First Ritual Guide:

Maintain book + offline app model for accessibility.

Partnership Potential:

Open to collaborating with Saudi-licensed Bangladeshi operators.

Quotes & Memorable Statements
“DIY is about two-thirds the cost of an agency trip.”

“The agency system is a pyramid of middlemen.”

“I skipped Ziyarat entirely because the schedule didn’t suit me.”

“Around Haram, I didn’t know where to eat or shop — no easy way to find out.”

Other Observations
Kaiyes is experienced, values independence, and seeks transparency.

Cost-conscious but prioritizes control and clarity.

Sees agencies as more useful for first-timers; experienced pilgrims benefit from self-managed travel with trusted tools.
