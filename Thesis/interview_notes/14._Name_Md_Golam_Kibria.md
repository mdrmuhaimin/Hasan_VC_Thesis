## 14. Name: Md Golam Kibria

### Raw Interview:

Muhammad:  This meeting is being recorded. Uh, thank you for uh joining in this um interview. Uh, we would like to get your opinion as someone who has performed uh multiple times Omrah and Hajj very recently uh to analyse some of the challenges you have faced uh during your journey that we can solve using uh technology, particularly AI and machine learning. Right. Uh, so first, I think it’s better to start with a short introduction. So, uh, as I um, like, we have brother Mohammed Kibria. So, brother, can you um, maybe uh, share a bit about your journey? Uh, how old were you when you did the journey, and which year was it, and maybe um, who travelled with you in some of the last journeys you have?
Kibria:  Salaam alaikum. Um, thanks for for this uh, uh, invitation to discuss about some of my experiences. So, my name is uh, MD Gulam Kibria. I'm originally from Bangladesh but uh, I've been living in Canada for the last 18 years. Um, so I am now 40, 42 years old. Um, I did my uh, first time like Omrah in 2022 with my wife. Um, so that was, so basically just after COVID, um, and then very recently, this year actually, I performed Hajj with my wife as well. Um, so yeah, overall, um, I mean, I learned, of course, a lot of things the first time when I went there. That time we arranged everything, basically from hotel booking to visa and everything. Um, I did it everything from uh, from here. Um, and then we basically uh, we spent about two weeks uh, during that Omrah time. It was quite busy that time because it was just after the COVID. Um, but I think that was really helpful for me to prepare for the Hajj because uh, um, a lot of things, at least the area where I'm going to stay and the surrounding area. So, that was very familiar to me. It was very um, easy for me to go from one place to the other. Um, but in brief, yeah, that was the first time and then very recently I spent 20 uh, 25 days uh, in Makkah and Medina. I um, travelled with a group from Dhaka uh, with a group of people, more than 200 probably. So, it was it was a really good experience. Maybe I can stop here and then anything specific you want to draw.
Muhammad:  Yeah. So, for example, uh, like first time you did it by yourself, and uh, then uh, this time for Hajj obviously you have to travel with a group. So, can you share uh, next time, inshallah, when you are planning to do Omrah, would you prefer to go with a travel agency or go by yourself and why?
Kibria:  Uh, probably I will prefer to do everything by myself because um, as I said, I know um, the rituals, what to do, and um, also I can book a hotel and I can get a visa with my Canadian passport, it's even easier. So, I don't see anywhere I need uh, help from a travel agency. So, as I mentioned, even for the very first time when I went there, I did it myself, um, together with my wife. So, um, of course, there were areas because I was not sure how far we were staying and all these things. But now I'm quite uh, comfortable that I, I'll be able to go by myself with my family. Inshallah, I'm planning to go uh, with my kids as well if Allah allows uh, next time. Um, but yeah, that's that's my plan. But for Hajj, I think it's definitely uh, we need to go with a group of people. Um, but Omrah, probably, it's it's it's not um, required, at least for for ourselves.
Muhammad:  Okay. So, when you do the Omrah by yourself, like, what are some of the most challenging things you have faced and how did you resolve this? Like, share like your experience as a first timer when you did your Omrah for the first time, right?
Kibria:  Yeah, sure. So, first time, uh, I was quite overwhelmed with that area. It was so, so, I mean, big area, and I was not sure where I am, I am right now, because uh, it was a little bit uh, yeah, just after COVID, and I went there and that time it was, the crowd was so big that time uh, because a lot of people were waiting for to perform Hajj and Umrah, and they could not go due to the COVID. So, and once they opened, there were like so many people there, so, and it was in Ramadan, so it was even more crowded, right? So, uh, I remember when I went there, we were living a little bit far from from uh, from Haram. It was probably um, probably uh, 25, 30 minutes or so. And um, so my experience, first experience was like, okay, um, the hotel management was definitely not not as cooperative as I was expecting. Um, there was supposed to be a shuttle bus. Sometimes the shuttle bus comes, if they come there, then I can go to the, to Haram, otherwise I have to take a taxi. So, it was not very uh, well organized, I would say, um, and partly because the hotels are a little bit far. So, if next time if I go, definitely I will not stay far from the Haram because it, it becomes very difficult to perform uh, five prayers, right? Uh, other than that, um, like, um, I was not prepared for, for example, when I was doing Tawaf on the mat, so of course it was easy. And then when in the second floor, we, we thought, okay, we'll do it in the second floor, and then the second floor, we didn't realize that it's almost like a 7 km. So, that time we, we had a lot of speed. We thought, okay, we'll do it. But after we finished, my wife was literally put on walk. I was like, okay, right? Because um, she was, she didn't even realize that she is walking so much, uh, right? So, uh, and this time when I went for Hajj, then I told her, do you want to do the Tawaf in the second floor, right? Because again, you need to prepare yourself otherwise don't go there, right? So, those things I think it would be nice to get prepared that okay, what you are going to do and how long is it going to take and all these things. The preparation, mental preparation and physical preparation, I think those are very important, we, um, it's very important. I realized that when in, in Canada, we don't walk too much, like, I'm sitting in my office for the whole day and then literally walking to, and even when I'm going to the mosque, it's just 5 minutes drive. So, I'm not walking at all. So, that was, I found, not uh, not good at least when you are going to Hajj and Umrah, you need to, you need to walk a lot, right? So, and um, so if, if I knew, maybe I had to prepare for that, and and that was also difficult at the first time. Um, but everything went well when I went for the Hajj this time, because I was with the group, so I know where they are going and where I need to go, and I was a bit mentally prepared. Okay, this this ritual I, I need at least this amount of time for Safa and Marwa, then I, I need probably one or two hours at least. So, those kind of things, it helps if you prepare with that, what you are going to do.
Muhammad:  Like, you have like a quite an amazing experience. Um, I'm curious like first time when you booked the hotel, uh, which portal you booked the hotel from, when you—
Kibria:  I think it was Booking.com.
Muhammad:  Okay. So, did they advertise like the bus with the hotel will have shuttle?
Kibambia:  Yeah, they said that there will be shuttle bus. Uh, but then the first thing when I went there, they said there's no reservation. I was like, no way. I showed them the paper from Booking.com and uh, and then they somehow managed that. But then there were some issues with the shuttle bus. Okay. Um, it was not well organized, that's what I, I would say. They, they had shuttle bus, but not that, not that frequently or not.
Muhammad:  So, have you not checked like the review of previous people who uh, booked this hotel uh, from Booking.com and so on?
Kibria:  I prob, I think usually for buying anything I check online some reviews and so on, but in the review sometimes it's not very helpful because you can get all these different types of comments. Oh, these are good, some people have good experience, some people have bad experience. Like in, in Amazon when you buy something, um, of course we look at the ratings and the reviewers, I mean, the customers' feedback, but um, sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. Okay. Uh, so uh, regarding um, like Ramadan, it's actually a very tough time to go on. Uh, so um, and alhamdulillah, like Allah was able to solve you um, those challenges. I'm just curious, were you able to do any uh, Ziyarah, like visiting uh, various uh, places uh, like in uh, in Makkah and Madina?
Kibria:  Yeah. Yeah. We uh, we took a kind of a, a taxi that time. Um, and that uh, it was a Bangladeshi guy. So, he was, he was taking us to um, most of the common places, like um, you go for Ziyarah in in Makkah, probably not not really. But in Madina we went uh, for Ziyarah. In, in Makkah, I don't know why we didn't go um, but I mean, there are not many places outside of Makkah actually. So, but in in in Madina there are, there are a couple of places. So, we went there with with a, with a taxi. Um, yeah.
Muhammad:  Okay. Um, so when it comes to online hotel booking like Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia, they are very uh, popular one but there are other smaller vendors as well, right? So, for example, if we started a new uh, booking portal focusing on Hajj and Umrah, would it, would it take for you to have like the same trust as like Booking.com or Expedia.com with the portal?
Kibria:  Um, if it is, first of all, if it is new, then um, like for example, with Booking.com, I have booked many times, so I know um, that they are reliable. So, reliability, I think, is very important that I don't want to be a surprise, though I booked and then when I go there, um, I don't see my booking or reservation, right? So, that reliability and trust is important, and for any new like a portal, it will take some time for sure to to build that trust and customer feedback. So, um, but if I know that who uh, let's say this portal is managed by a certain group that I know of, right? Like they are well reputed there in in in the Muslim community for example, right? So, then I know, okay, this is a place I can trust. So, I can definitely love to go and see and of course if someone has gone through them and get some their feedback, so that will make me comfortable that, okay, uh, it's it's reliable. Um, so I think that's most important. Other than that, um, the price that I see in Booking.com, there are so many options. If I see that uh, in a new portal, um, that would be also good. Um, yeah. Um, other than that, the accessibility, I just want to make sure the portal is operating, right? There's no issues with the portal. It's always accessible and so on. Yeah, these are definitely most, most important.
Muhammad:  I see. No, that's definitely makes sense. Um, in terms of um, Ziyarah, uh, you say like you took a Bangladeshi taxi driver uh, who didn't show you that much in Makkah but in Madina I think it was—
Kibria:  Medina. Yeah.
Muhammad:  So, how was your experience with transportation from airport to Makkah, Madina, and also like um, other transportation? How was the transportation? How does it, was it easy or you feel like there are lots of uh, sketchy practices in the transportation sector?
Kibria:  Um, in like from Jeddah to Makkah airport. Um, so, so that like I, so it's more like you have to uh, like every taxi driver, they have their own prices, though. So, that is no kind of a standard practice. So, and that is I think it's not good for any foreigner, someone going there for the first time. I'm not sure how much it should, what is actually the, it, the range should, should be the, the, the price should be. The fare, like I was not very sure, is it like 300 Riyal or is it 100 Riyal or 200 Riyal? So, um, so if there is a standard practice, okay, the fair rate is, let's say, 200 Riyal from Makkah, from Jeddah to Makkah or Makkah to Jeddah. So, these kind of things I found is, is not standardized and that becomes problematic for anyone new to this, that area. And the second thing is also for the taxi drivers within Makkah and Madina, it's so much like you have to bargain and uh, sometimes they ask maybe two, three times more than what is the actual fare, and and depending on uh, if you know how far you are going and those things, you have to bargain. And again there is no uh, such practice or any um, they have these meters, but I don't, I have not seen anyone following the meter. So, if there is any anything like that that would be definitely better for any visitors. Um, between Makkah and Madina, we took a train, the bullet train, and that was I think very good experience to be honest. It was really good. Two hours and we, we were in Madina. Um, so the journey was really good. Um, no problem at all. But the same thing as I said, in Madina, uh, the taxi drivers were not very, a lot of them of course they don't speak English. That's a big problem and we don't speak Arabic so the communication gap was there but overall I would say the fair practice was not there. If there is any way to standardize it, um, that will help digital for sure.
Muhammad:  No, I think that makes sense. So, brother Kibria, uh, based on um, like your experience with Omrah and technology, what is your thought on where technology can come in and solve this problem? Like from hotel booking, you're already using technology but in your, but you faced some difficulty, so maybe share um, how you think this could be better and what are some of the things Booking.com should have. Uh, then, secondly, um, for your experience with Tawaf, Sa'i, all of this local information, how are the things that you think that are the things you think technology can solve then problems with, right? Uh, and information and Ziyarah, all of these things you have done. So, maybe share your insight, how you think this might make better.
Kibria:  Um, well, from the technology side, um, for example, things like um, uh, for transportation, if I talk about it specifically for transportation, um, what I heard is that Uber doesn't work that time. So, I find Uber is very easy to work, I mean, use, and to to call a taxi. And it's it's that's what I use here in Canada, right? Um, but during the Hajj time, someone was telling me that you cannot find Uber at this particular time but before and after it is open or something like that. So, I would really love to see some app where you can just call a taxi through your app. The rate is fixed so you don't have to even talk about it. You can see the fare. So, some if there is any sort of app that can do the job, that will be fantastic. Second thing, through that app you can book uh, local transportation, for example, Makkah bus. So, I was really having issue to pay for the Makkah bus because um, uh, like my credit card. So, initially there was some issue with my um, not the credit card. So, they had, I forgot exactly what was the issue, but I was not able to pay uh, the exact fare in Makkah bus. So, that's a local transportation, right? So, um, but then I was able to uh, pay through, oh, I remember now. Um, because I was using my Bangladesh SIM and uh, when I'm trying to pay my with my credit card, they were trying to send a PIN number to my Canadian phone number, and I am not using my Canadian phone number, right? So, they were, they were not able to verify is it authentic transaction or not. So, I was really having trouble to pay um, to buy ticket for Makkah bus. But luckily I was able to pay with Apple app, uh, Apple, Apple uh, yeah, Apple tap or Apple Pay, sorry, Apple Pay. So, with Apple Pay I, I uh, my credit card information was there, so I was able to pay. So, if there is an app that can kind of reconcile all this transportation in one place. So, if I need to buy a ticket to uh, go take a local transportation, I would be able to do that. If I want to buy, get a taxi, I would be able to get do that. So, from the transportation side, maybe there is a way to reconcile in one app and through that you buy whatever you want, even train ticket and so on.
Muhammad:  Just to interrupt one thing. So uh, so for transportation uh, there is some regulation that uh, there in Makkah. So uh, incorporating all into one app like booking, what if the app supports you with information? Right. So if you say you want to go to point A to B, it will tell you a price range, it will like you can take Makkah bus. Same way like a guide will tell you, like you, like—
Kibria:  Right. Yeah.
Muhammad:  So, you're not able to book it but you will get the information like if—
Kibria:  That also, that also helps to to a lot uh, because then I know um, like what is the, where is the actual place where I need to buy ticket because I was asking the bus driver and he is talking in Arabic. Ticket. I, I was not sure how to buy ticket. So, yeah, if the information is already there in the app, then I know where to go and where to buy ticket. Um, so yeah, so that that thing um, same for transportation between Makkah and Jeddah and then Makkah to Madina. If there are ways, um, of course train is good but a bit expensive for some people, right? Um, so if there is any app where you can book uh, like there are a lot of local um, like a taxi drivers who who would go between Makkah and Madina but is there, if there is any app where you you can just book them otherwise you have to wait in on the street and then ask for uh, like, like those drivers who want to go to Madina. Um, yeah so that's pretty much uh, from the transportation side. Um, on the actual like rituals I think um, again if we can put all the information in in the app for example uh, I was uh, I found that book that we got from shepherd handy where there they have lot of or most of the duas um, that are mentioned in Quran and in Hadith, right? So, literally because I don't remember all of these duas but I, when I was uh, because there are so many places where you can you can make dua for a long time and you run out of your duas, right? So, I found that book very handy when I can see all my duas in one place. So, if you can put those duas in in the app and then I can just go through that so I know that I I, I kind of uh, prayed or recited all those duas. So, that will be at least a peace of mind for me that I'm not missing out anything. Same thing in in Arafah because people run out of duas, right? So, those people will find it very handy when they have all the duas mentioned in Quran and also in Hadith. So, I was literally taking that book and um, all the time with me. So, if it is in the phone, definitely it will be easier. Um, and then uh, just to uh, so one of the solution we are thinking of to help people juggle their memory, we are actually creating like an AI chatbot that will have like a natural conversation with you and it will ask people like what do you want, maybe it will remind you how you want to envision yourself after your death, how you want to see your children, what are some of your immediate life goals, where you go settle, right? It will, Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala does not forbid us to ask from dunya, He encourages us through Quran and the Sunnah, Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, to ask a good life in dunya and akhirah as well.
Muhammad:  So if an AI chatbot can converse with you and coach you how to get the right dua, do you think that'd be helpful inshallah and it also like using the Sunnah of making dua, it will augment it so using like right names of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, using the name of like the sending salutations, Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, those things, do you think that would be helpful?
Kibria:  That uh, Um, that could be one way but I think like if you categorize them, for example, in the Nusuk app, I found it is very useful that like um, duas for, let's say, uh, for Shifa, right? So, there are a couple of duas categorized them, right? So, I don't have to ask the chatbot and, okay, which one I should, I can, I, I already know there are five duas there, I will go through that, right? So, if there is any any way to already put it there and you can keep the chatbot option that okay, you can, if someone wants to ask anything uh, for example, about Ruqyah, if you have some and some duas, okay, which duas I should be reciting. So, and then have it uh, as I say in the Nusuk app, I think it's very nicely organized in in a way that, okay, it is categorized based on the need, so that's that could be other option to think about. Um, same thing in in, there are a couple of good things I found in Anusuk app. The Qibla direction is quite helpful if you're travelling a lot, right? Um, I found it is, it works pretty well. Like a lot of these Qibla apps don't work but this one I found is working pretty well. Same thing um, prayer time, uh, let's say you are travelling with your with the app and you are you are uh, travelling to Paris and then let's say the app will be updated automatically where based on your location and it will tell you what is the prayer time. So, those things uh, again there are other apps but if you want to make it uh, embedded in your app, that's that's quite helpful. At least I, I use it after coming back from Hajj. I still use them for those particular things when I need to know uh, like Qibla direction, as I said, the number of Tawafs there, so those are very helpful. Um, and then on the visual side. Um, I think it's, it's not too complicated. Initially I thought, okay, what, what are the steps? How do we do that? But when we did that, I found it's, it's not, it's not complicated. You just have to follow those five days of uh, rituals and but if if you want to consolidate that in in an app, okay, day one, these are the activities. So, you have to do this, day two, day three, day four and day five. Right. And um, anything associated that you need for that day. Um, for example um, when you are going for to uh, Jamarat for um, for a stone throwing a stone, right? So, if there is any, anything, any context, if you can, if you want to add, let's say someone wants to know a little bit more about that. So, if there is any way that you can click and then go to that place, okay, what happened here and why we do that? So, some sort of uh, you know, a lot of people they don't know even why they are throwing stone, right? So, if if if you think that can add value, maybe it will add some value that okay, some people, so this is why uh, we need to do this and uh, what what is the story behind this, right? So, what happened in this place and that place, those could be uh, some, some small things but could be useful. Um, what else that comes to on top of my head but now but um—
Muhammad:  What about the training itself, right? So, so I, I would expect, right? So, before going to Hajj, uh, you know, like you are doing the training online, uh, to understand like logistics—
Kibria:  Oh, yes, yeah. Okay, yeah, that's something I forgot. Uh, so what happened is that uh, there was probably 12 or 13 training sessions, right? And those training sessions it was definitely very informative. It's helpful but the problem was there are so many, it's a day long for us. It was not easy because it starts at night and then finishes in the in the morning, right? So, the timing was definitely doesn't work for us. But for the training, those can be consolidated in in a, in a way that, okay, these are the takeaway points or these are uh, maybe some short clips which where you summarize everything because there's no point of putting all these videos in a in an app, right? Because if someone wants to see that they can go to YouTube and so on. But maybe a short version of that or maybe the key takeaway points that we discussed if anyone wants to understand or learn more, maybe they can go to somewhere here or there, right? But the app could like basically if someone goes through the app and those takeaway points, they will not miss out anything, right? But of course, it's not enough if someone wants to know more. There are other places to do that um, because again is, yeah, those I think that would be helpful. Um, I tried to attend a couple of them but again there are um, those are again those are helpful but it's too long for, because there are a lot of discussions happening with in that room and it's not uh, easy for us to understand what's going on in because those online sessions um, is probably good for people who are attending in person but not those for who are joining online so many times that there's a break one hour break to like for prayer and so on but then we are sitting here, right? So, I think there could be a way to make it more shorter versions of those ones with some more like the information that you really they need to need and yeah, so that that's what I think.
Muhammad:  And um, you said brother you also use the Nusuk app after Hajj as well. So, uh, what like and you use it for prayer time, dua and Qibla direction. So, I think what would be a great after Hajj app would be, so if you're looking for an after Hajj app feature, what would be your uh, thought? Uh, after Hajj prayer, uh, sorry, after Hajj um, things that we should uh, we should practice on our daily life, maybe things those are as a reminder, um, right? So, there are a lot of discussions from scholars that what to do after Hajj, right? Um, so it, it can come handy if if there, there is kind of a um, what is that called, um, uh, sort of reminders that come in your app, right? There are many apps that bring that gives you some reminders. So, maybe those tips uh, on a daily basis, daily tips or something that comes up, pops up in your in your phone. Um, of course it starts with five times prayer in the mosque and then um, like treating everyone nicely and those kind of things. So, um, probably that's most important so that we do not lose the spirit of Hajj and um, right? So, that's that's very important um, things that that that we should avoid um, right? Uh, staying, staying away from sin. So, what are the typical common um, sins that people do, uh, backbiting, those kind of things? Try to avoid those things, right? Um, so do not get into unnecessary discussions, talks or it's useless talks and so on. I, I think probably some useful tips that that are important are to remind everyone on a daily basis.
Muhammad:  I see, that is uh, very helpful. So, brother, if there is an app that contains all of these things uh, and also combines your hotel booking as well. So, for example like an AI online travel guide. So, for example, the same way you travel with someone, that person maybe an elder brother or like elder that reminds you and gives you in every step and that app will do the same like a travel companion. Do you think it would add value for you and would you be willing to pay for such a solution?
Kibria:  I think so, if it it serves my purpose, it, it helps me to um, give some guidance in terms of okay, do do this and do that. So, with all this information, sometimes even uh, I think I can think of uh, asking that, asking AI, okay, um, what to do in this situation? Basically, there are so many Q&A that I found also helpful in that in that booklet that we got from from Shepherd, right? So, there are so many questions and answers, they're already there and these are common questions, right? So, but it's always good that if I ask a chatbot and basically it will be connected with those answers, you don't have um, uh, like it's not some random answers, it's basically authentic answers, okay, in this situation what should I do, right? So, and then the AI will tell us, okay, uh, based on this um, like an authentic information from here and here, this is you should do, so then it's definitely quite helpful for me and I don't have to uh, look for another place or look someone, ask someone what to do and so on. You find it as a handy um, like as I said, some of the questions are very common, right? So, yeah, it can be quite come as handy and yeah, I'm sure it um, like if we find it useful, we, we pay for so many things, we pay for Google Drive, we pay for this and that, right? So, definitely you'll be happy to pay for those kind of solutions.
Muhammad:  And how much you, you may be willing to pay? Like the amount, monetary amount? What do you think would be the right amount?
Kibria:  I don't know. Um, if I just compare with some of the other apps I am paying for example, um, ChatGPT $20 USD per month um, and then Google, sorry, Dropbox for example, it's it's not, I mean typical app, but I'm just saying they are providing some service, right? So, in that sense, um, $13, $14 USD per month. Right. Um, Google, I probably pay $4, $5, much cheaper. So, somewhere I would say um, I don't know, $5 to $10 is probably is a lot of people will not find it anything. I mean, it will be quite easy to pay for these kind of things.
Muhammad:  Okay. So, something like maybe $15 one-time fee and afterwards for reminder duas, like reminder—
Kibria:  Maybe two per month if somebody want to—
Muhammad:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. During the Hajj time I think someone can pay more because those will be useful. After Hajj you can, there are different rates, something like that. Yeah.
Muhammad:  Yeah. Um, and Kibria, like alhamdulillah you've done Hajj a few months back. How are you feeling? Sorry if it's a sensitive question, if you don't want to, you can skip that. But just for research purpose, how do you feeling? Like the spirituality factor is there and uh, what are some of the challenges you face? Uh, so do you think this is uh, and what are the techniques you are using to have the spirit of Hajj within you and like a different life that you like live before Hajj. So that's the last question basically.
Kibria:  Sure. Um, yeah, also a difficult question as well, right? Um, well, I spiritually um, I don't know how much I have changed um, uh, Well, I, I definitely something is different before and after um, in terms of my overall feeling for for the Deen, how I practice Deen and how I teach Deen to my kids, to my family. So, I definitely have a different viewpoint at this point like especially um, when we're living abroad in a Western country, right? So, the way I look at uh, like the worldly life versus my practicing my Deen, right? So, prioritizing my daily, I mean, my job versus prioritizing my Deen. So, I think the balance has gone towards more towards practicing and inclining towards the Deen where what I used to do before. Uh, for example, sometimes I am too much busy with meetings and so on, and now I'm trying to take breaks when it's a time for prayer, I'm really trying to do that, right? So, um, when it's time for prayer, so I, I cannot delay my prayer because it is important to pray at, at the beginning of the time, right? So, um, similarly like missing our prayers in in the mosque, again it's some, we always have excuse in Western country, it's a little bit far, it will take 10 minutes to go there and so on and so forth. So, um, so again it's, is how you prioritize this one, right? So, if it is 10 minutes but you are spending 10 minutes for your Deen, for for praying in the mosque, which is which is much better than praying at your home, right? So, um, Yeah, alhamdulillah. I, I think I uh, I'm trying uh, at least I have, as I said, my uh, thought process has changed especially when it comes to teaching my kids and I'm honestly thinking and putting my thoughts on whether I should really stay in in this country or I should go back, right? So, because this thought I didn't have before going to Hajj. After coming almost every day we were talking at home that probably this is not not the right environment uh, to grow kids, to to raise kids here because of so many factors, right? And and at the same time when in parallel when I'm looking at my my uh, my nephews who are growing up in in Bangladesh in they are they they are um, studying in Madrasah very well um, uh, organized and so on uh, until one of them became Hafiz already, the second one is studying there. So, I see their manner versus the manners of the kids here. So, I could see a vast difference, right? So, yeah, after coming back, I'm really putting more thoughts whether what's the best approach here because I'm not sure um, um, pray for me so that I take that I, I right decision what's the best for me for my Deen, for my family. But this is something I, as I said, before Hajj, I was not serious about it, but after Hajj, maybe Allah has given me something in my mind that has changed my the way of thinking. So, so yeah, that's that's pretty much um, the realization if you like to say um, in in like before and after coming back from Hajj.
Muhammad:  Yeah. So, dua, inshallah, I will sincerely be making dua, like Allah give you and all of us like righteous family and Allah guide you whatever is uh, best for your family. Um, thank you, Kibria. Um, I think I got lots of valuable insight from you and I think I got uh, lots of um, uh, support uh, through your interview. It's very inspiring. Inshallah um, feel free to reach out if you have any idea, anything, any suggestion for me for this app. Inshallah please share with me. Inshallah this would be a very good effort. So, with that, inshallah, I'd like to thank you for your time and for sharing this interview. Salaam.
Kibria:  Thank you so much for the interview and I think what you are doing is is definitely could be quite impactful for the um, uh, and uh, I can see that that you have the right intention to really help people. So, uh, with that, it can be quite valuable. It can come very handy for a lot of people who are going there for the first time, who doesn't know um, what to do and where to start. It can be quite helpful and yeah, jazakallah khair for for taking that initiative.
Muhammad:  Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.

### Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Pilgrimage Type(s): Kibria has performed Umrah and Hajj.
• Year(s):
    ◦ First Umrah: 2022, just after COVID.
    ◦ Hajj: Very recently, in the current year (of the interview).
• Trip Setup:
    ◦ First Umrah (2022): Traveled with his wife. He arranged everything himself, including hotel booking and visa, from Canada. They spent about two weeks.
    ◦ Hajj (recently): Traveled with his wife. They went with a group of over 200 people from Dhaka. They spent 20 to 25 days in Makkah and Madina.
    ◦ Future Umrah Plans: Kibria plans to do Umrah by himself with his family (including his kids, if Allah allows). He feels comfortable arranging it independently now that he knows the rituals and finds it easy to get a visa with his Canadian passport.
    ◦ Hajj Requirement: He believes Hajj definitely requires traveling with a group.
Journey / Context
• Travel Experience:
    ◦ His first Umrah was "quite busy" due to it being just after COVID, which resulted in a very large crowd. It was also during Ramadan, making it even more crowded.
    ◦ The initial Umrah experience was "really helpful" for preparing for Hajj, as he became familiar with the area and found it easy to navigate.
    ◦ For Hajj, being with a group helped him know where to go and he was "a bit mentally prepared" for the rituals and their durations.
    ◦ Travel between Makkah and Madina was done by bullet train, which was a "very good experience" taking only two hours.
• Accommodations:
    ◦ During his first Umrah, he stayed a bit far from the Haram, approximately 25-30 minutes away.
    ◦ He booked his hotel through Booking.com.
• Service Providers:
    ◦ The hotel management was "definitely not as cooperative" as expected regarding the promised shuttle bus service during his first Umrah.
    ◦ For Ziyarah (visiting various places), they took a taxi with a Bangladeshi driver. They visited common places in Madina but not much in Makkah.
    ◦ The Hajj pilgrimage was with a group from Dhaka, comprising more than 200 people.
Pain Points / Challenges
• Overcrowding: The first Umrah, post-COVID and during Ramadan, was extremely crowded as many people who couldn't travel earlier were now able to perform the pilgrimage.
• Poor Facilities/Logistics:
    ◦ Hotel Shuttle Service: The hotel advertised a shuttle bus, but it was "not well organized" and "not that frequently" available, sometimes leaving him to take a taxi.
    ◦ Distance from Haram: Staying far from the Haram made it "very difficult to perform five prayers" at the mosque.
    ◦ Physical Preparation for Rituals: He was not prepared for the physical demands of Tawaf, especially on the second floor, which he later realised was almost 7 km long. His wife was "literally put on walk" due to exhaustion. He emphasised the importance of "mental preparation and physical preparation".
    ◦ Transportation (Taxis):
        ▪ Lack of Standardized Fares: From Jeddah to Makkah, there's "no kind of a standard practice" for taxi fares, leaving foreigners unsure of the "fair rate".
        ▪ Bargaining Culture: Within Makkah and Madina, taxi drivers often demand "two, three times more than what is the actual fare," necessitating constant bargaining.
        ▪ Unused Meters: Drivers have meters but are "not seen anyone following the meter".
        ▪ Communication Gap: A "big problem" was that many taxi drivers "don't speak English," while he doesn't speak Arabic.
    ◦ Local Bus Payment Issues: He faced trouble paying for Makkah bus tickets because his credit card's PIN verification was tied to his Canadian phone number (which he wasn't using with his Bangladesh SIM). He eventually managed to pay using Apple Pay.
• Lack of Guidance/Information:
    ◦ During his first Umrah, he felt "quite overwhelmed" by the "big area" and was "not sure where I am right now".
    ◦ He lacked knowledge about the duration of rituals, such as Safa and Marwa taking "one or two hours at least".
    ◦ He struggled to buy Makkah bus tickets due to the bus driver speaking Arabic and not knowing where to purchase them.
    ◦ Many people, including himself, are unaware of the context or stories behind certain rituals, such as "why they are throwing stone" at Jamarat.
    ◦ Hajj Training Sessions: The 12-13 online training sessions provided by the Hajj group were "very informative" but "too long" and "day long," often starting at night and finishing in the morning, making it difficult for him to attend. Online participants found it hard to follow due to discussions among in-person attendees and prayer breaks.
    ◦ Trust in New Booking Platforms: Kibria noted that it "will take some time for sure to to build that trust and customer feedback" for any new portal compared to established ones like Booking.com, where he knows they are "reliable".
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Technology Use (Particularly AI and Machine Learning):
    ◦ Hotel Booking Portal: A new Hajj and Umrah booking portal could gain trust if it's "managed by certain group that I know of," especially if they are "well reputed...in the Muslim community." Customer feedback, price options, and accessibility are also crucial.
    ◦ Integrated Transportation App:
        ▪ An app that allows users to call a taxi with a "fixed rate" to eliminate bargaining, similar to Uber (which he heard doesn't work during Hajj).
        ▪ An app that can "reconcile all this transportation in one place" for buying local bus tickets, taxis, and even train tickets.
        ▪ Even if direct booking is not possible due to regulations, the app could provide essential information like price ranges, which local bus to take, and where to buy tickets, acting as a guide.
        ▪ An app to book local taxi drivers for inter-city travel (e.g., Makkah to Madina) to avoid having to "wait in on the street" to find drivers.
    ◦ Ritual Guidance App:
        ▪ Consolidated Duas: An app should contain all duas "mentioned in Quran and in Hadith," ideally categorized by need (e.g., for Shifa), similar to how the Nusuk app organizes them. This provides "peace of mind" that nothing is missed.
        ▪ AI Chatbot for Duas/Guidance: While a categorized list is preferable for duas, an AI chatbot could be helpful for specific questions, providing "authentic answers" based on verified information.
        ▪ Structured Ritual Information: The app could consolidate the "five days of rituals" (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) with associated activities. It could also provide context or stories behind rituals (e.g., "what happened here and why we do that" for throwing stones at Jamarat) to add value and understanding.
        ▪ Concise Hajj Training: The app could offer "short clips" or "key takeaway points" from the extensive Hajj training sessions, providing essential information without needing to watch long videos, with links for those who want to learn more.
    ◦ Post-Hajj App Features: After Hajj, an app could provide daily reminders or tips to help maintain the "spirit of Hajj," such as prompts for five daily prayers in the mosque, treating people nicely, and avoiding common sins like backbiting and useless talks.
    ◦ Comprehensive AI Online Travel Guide/Companion: Kibria believes an app that combines hotel booking, all the mentioned features, and acts like a "travel companion" providing guidance at every step would "add value" and he would be "willing to pay for such a solution". He suggested a price point of $5 to $10 USD per month, or a one-time fee of around $15 with a lower monthly fee (e.g., $2) for post-Hajj reminders, noting that users might pay more during Hajj time.
• Better Accommodation Options: He strongly suggested staying closer to the Haram to avoid difficulties with daily prayers. If staying far, the hotel's shuttle bus service needs to be "well organized" and frequent.
• Improved Crowd Management: While not directly offering solutions, the experience highlighted the need for better management strategies, especially during peak seasons like Ramadan post-COVID.

Other Observations
• Service Delivery Patterns:
    ◦ Online reviews for hotels (e.g., on Booking.com) are often "not very helpful" due to varying customer experiences.
    ◦ Group travel for Hajj proved to be beneficial for organisation and mental preparation, contrasting with the self-arranged Umrah experience.
• Emotional Responses:
    ◦ Kibria felt "overwhelmed" by the sheer size and crowd of the area during his first Umrah.
    ◦ He recognised a significant spiritual shift after Hajj, leading to a greater prioritisation of his Deen (religious practice) over worldly life. This includes making conscious efforts to pray on time and in the mosque, despite typical excuses.
    ◦ The spiritual impact of Hajj led him to seriously consider whether remaining in a Western country is the best environment for raising his children, noting a "vast difference" in manners between children growing up in Bangladesh (e.g., in Madrasah) and those in Canada. This thought process was new to him post-Hajj.
    ◦ He expressed enthusiasm for the proposed technology solution, believing it would be "quite valuable" and "handy" for pilgrims, especially first-timers.
