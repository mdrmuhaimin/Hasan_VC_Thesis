## 13. Name: Mahmud Iqbal

### Raw Interview:

Context: Mahmud Iqbal Halim has performed Hajj and Umrah. This interview focuses on his service delivery experiences, planning process, and any religious guidance gaps he faced, along with possible solutions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Segment 1] Muhammad: Hi John. Hello. G. Okay. Alhamdulillah. Studio, for sure. Multiple monthly public for inviting me. I think so. Something like this.
Muhammad: Okay, you can start by introducing yourself for inviting me for this noble cause. May Allah bless your intention, brother.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: My name is [best guess: Mahmud Iqbal Halim]. Alhamdulillah, I was able to complete the holy journey of Hajj this year, 2025, which was like 1446 Hijri. And I joined the journey from Bangladesh even though I'm staying in Canada, and for my experience, I try my best to help give the best question answer possible.
[Segment 2] Muhammad: Okay. Um, so by, um, as you live in Canada, um, and you have dual Bangladesh and Canadian nationality, you have the option to do from either country. So, what made you choose your Hajj to do from Bangladesh instead of Canada?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: So, I think there are perspectives from different ways I can explain. Initially, I was not able to even think about it because I have little kids to take care of, like one is five, another was like three and a half. So, the main challenge was for me to think about their custody while we were away. Like, we went, me and my wife, along with my mom joined us. So, we were thinking to bring some of the relatives here, but ideally, we couldn't find anyone. So, our only option was to keep the kids at some relatives' place so that we have no tension about them. And also, budget-wise, I think it's pretty expensive even here in from Canada, even though you can save a lot of time if you fly from Canada way back to Saudi to Canada again. But alhamdulillah, when I came to know it's possible to use my Bangladeshi passport, and everything was like giving me a positive vibe that I can do it from Bangladesh, even though there will be an added journey. But everything was smooth, alhamdulillah. And yes, that's it. Budget and custody of my children when I'll be performing the Hajj was my consideration to going from Bangladesh.
Muhammad: Okay, inshallah. Um, let's move to the next segment, which is preparation, right? So, you came right after Hajj to Bangladesh. So, I believe many of the preparations you took were through online class and watching the recording of the meeting. So, do you feel it was sufficient for you to understand what you need to do spiritually and logistically just by watching the training online and watching recorded videos?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, of course. I would say that was a great help to prepare myself, not only logistically, but also, as you said, from a spiritual perspective. I tried to follow as much as I could the lecture sessions or like the webinar shared by the agency. By the way, the agency we went with was like Shepard Umrah Service, I believe their full name. They're pretty professional and very cooperative, I would say. And they actually offered all the sessions way back, our primary registration, and that helped us to, you know, build up the momentum regarding the preparation from all around the aspects, like being it logistic, what do we need to do, including every single detail, like any minor thing, how to prepare even for your physical fitness and all the paperworks if you are coming for short terms, including medical tests and stuff like that. And also how to prepare and the documents, especially because you are traveling from another country, right? So the sessions were conducted by the agency guides as well as their sheikhs or scholars who will help us to shape our training period for this holy journey. And alhamdulillah, it was super helpful to get the real feel how it's going to look like in real time.
[Segment 3] Muhammad: I see. Now, the second thing is regarding this training, which I believe was really helpful for you. Do you have to take any additional training from YouTube videos or from other sources, or that was pretty sufficient?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: In some cases, I had my own questions because the sessions and webinars were mostly live, but I couldn't join the live one because of the time difference, you know? Like there is 10-11 hours difference between the training happening live and the time we live here in North America. So when I had some questions, I used to ask other people who joined us before me, like last year or so, with the same agency, or even they had the experience beforehand. I used to go to them, discuss, and also watch for sessions or lectures on a specific topic on YouTube. So those were helpful, but I felt like if I wasn't present in person, maybe I could have a better understanding or even, I mean, that could have been better in some ways, like, you know, team building. We went and we shared, like, a lot of people, like in my room, I was sharing the room with like four other people, the brothers came along all across the world. But I felt like with the management team, I could have made a good relationship. But even though that was not that impactful, like knowing them and seeing them for the first time when I was in Mecca. But, yep, I mean, pretty much it was quite okay for me.
[Segment 4] Muhammad: Okay. So, for example, next time if you go to Hajj or Umrah, though you did it once, if there is an app that has some video lectures and very practical training regarding how to perform Hajj and Umrah, just as a refresher, would you think it would be valuable for you?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I would say definitely it will add value, not only for the rituals but also a lot of stuff, I think they help you to make your preparation right. And I found that when you have preparation, especially for this holy journey, and it's like, I think this is the biggest crowd I have ever joined in any particular event. So it really helped a lot because I tried to find and follow some of the apps that were available at that time, like Nusuk, but I believe that was not customized or just for these events like Umrah. And all of the apps that I went through or like the guidelines, I think something was missing. And any interactive app should, I think, be more helpful for people like me going for the first time or even the second time. Of course, I gathered a lot of experience for the first time. But again, if I could do like a mock test in an interactive app, that could have a better impact. But I was doing it in real because a lot of things, as you plan, but it's a huge gathering and that's like unbelievable rush. So having an app definitely would keep you in line, right? Like which ritual comes after what and what you need to do, especially making duas and doing the rituals. For example, like Umrah, when you enter the mosque, and even before that, when you are wearing your Ihram and you are not making the Nia since you are coming from a different zone, not in Saudi, right? So, yeah, if it's like on the app step by step, it gives the whole picture in front of you and you know what was missing and what is coming through and what dua or prayer you have to make, right? And step by step, it's really helpful to have an interactive app, not only just with the rituals, but also a lot of preparation materials, I mean, item-wise or action-wise, that would really help.
[Segment 5] Muhammad: I see. Have you used an app called Duolingo?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I actually didn't have Duolingo. I used like Google Translate, to be honest, that was a lifesaver.
Muhammad: No, no, I'm just asking, do you know how this quiz-based Duolingo app works?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Oh yeah, Duolingo. Yeah, I'm quite familiar with that.
Muhammad: So, do you think something like that, but for Hajj and Umrah? So the idea would be, before, so there's a learning module. So you can learn about in detail what is Hajj, Umrah, all the rituals, and then you can test your knowledge. And the knowledge would be, it will give you a scenario and it will ask which dua you would like to make and you have to find the dua. Then the second option would be to...
[Segment 6] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I think this is a great idea because, yeah, I mean, often I saw people, they were hesitant to ask questions to the fellow Hajji or even the scholar in that group or even the agency people. Sometimes they were not available. So yeah, that would be really good. But hey, again, there are scenarios that you never expect, right? But as long as you can cover the most common scenarios, yeah, I think that's a great idea.
Muhammad: Yeah, and then you can do like a quiz-based learning and first, like, maintaining serial, there can be small puzzles and games. So, for example, when you go to Hajj, there will be a scenario like, "Okay, which comes first, Mina, Arafat?" And then you have to arrange them together like a small puzzle. So, this way, you would learn this thing in an interactive way. So I'm thinking of doing this. Also, if you remember, during the times, the Qatine app that we are working on, that was beta, I think I gave you access. Were you able to install that?
[Segment 7] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yes, I was able to install that, but I believe there was some sort of troubleshooting you have been doing, right?
Muhammad: Yes. So, were you able to use it? At that time, it was not usable for you?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I think some of the features were usable, not all of them. I understand that was not fully released or there was like a beta version, right? (Yeah, yeah)
Muhammad: At that time, it only had the Umrah module. So, if you were able to use that, would you like to share some feedback regarding that?
[Segment 8] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, of course. So, when I started my journey from home, I was not quite sure when to wear the Ihram, for example. Should I wear it from my home or where should I make the Nia? And there was a little bit of confusion. As I told you, it's a rush and logistically, if you are taking too much on your shoulder, you have to figure out the other stuff, even though you are being joined by a couple of other people or friends or known faces, it comes at the end, how you are doing yourself. So I think at that time, if I had such kind of app, so that I can go to, I know what exactly I need to do, like what dua I need to make, or what time I need to make my Nia, or if there are any like Noah prayer, or what I can do or what I cannot do during my [inaudible - possibly Umrah/Hajj rituals]. So that was quite, I thought, that would be definitely helpful for that. And also when I went to the Haram...
[Segment 9] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...for the Tawaf, for the Sai, I was asking people what to do. And also, I was, you know, carrying too many notebooks with dua list, and some are recommended and some are mandatory, right? So an app like this, because we all carry phones, right, should make things easy.
Muhammad: So thank you for the feedback. Unfortunately, we just made the app available right after you performed Umrah. But next time you go to Umrah, you can definitely try it out because right now it is on full release in the market, and by that time, we can make it even better. Moving forward to the next question, how overwhelming it was when you moved to Makkah? Like, you have to have a long travel, like there was tiredness of traveling, visiting your luggage, getting settled in the hotel and doing Umrah right away. How difficult was it?
[Segment 10] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Honestly speaking, logistically, I didn't feel anything that difficult because, as I told you, part of our preparation was having patience all the time. Because what I came to know, the authority over there in Saudi, they're changing, they're ever variable and ever-changing. So, this time of the year, like in Hajj, it was super strict security-wise, and a lot of checks and restrictions came down to limit the number of unregistered Hajis. So, I didn't feel quite overwhelming because I was quite ready for it. Anything unexpected can happen. It actually started happening right away from the Hajj camp when we started our journey formally, before flying the plane. And also, when we boarded in Jeddah, the security or these after-procedures were really tiring. But, yeah, alhamdulillah, the preparation, the mental preparation was the key, you know. Sometimes you have nothing to do, you have to follow the rules, and the rules are ever-changing. That's the mindset I went with, and that helped me a lot. And I think if people have the information beforehand, they could have been, you know, more patient in some cases.
Muhammad: I think one thing you particularly did, if I remember, like we had a conversation and I gave an idea to you that to buy a SIM card from Bangladesh which has roaming capability, but you chose not to do so. So, do you think it was the right decision to buy the SIM card directly from there, or [inaudible]?
[Segment 11] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, again, it depends. It's a huge crowd, right, in just a couple of days, four to five days. But I saw people were having trouble with their roaming SIM in some cases, not all of the cases, because the Saudi SIM has a problem like in WhatsApp, you cannot make a call, you can just text. And for some people, obviously for senior people, texting is not a good solution. Not always. Like for my mom, she's not quite good at texting over the smartphone. So we saw people had a lot of issues. So what we did, we took a package for, I think, a week from Bangladesh SIM roaming. Then after that, we actually bought a package in Saudi SIM that was quite, I would say, a good decision in terms of communication. Because at the time of Mina or Arafat, you know, a lot of people are using the same area, so if you have the local SIM, that will give you an edge in terms of communication. And trust me, it gives you a lot less headache when you are lost in the Haram Sharif or any place in Arafat or Mina, to use a map. And I found it is working better. But what I did, I did download a manual offline map, I would say. But in terms of communication, I found it better to buy a SIM from Saudi, even though some people might find it expensive, but that gives you a lot of headache away.
[Segment 12] Muhammad: Out of headache, you can communicate with your family if you're going in a group. I see. So I think what you're saying is it's a good idea to buy a SIM card, but...
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Eventually you have to buy, if, if you, I mean, depending on your package. Initially, it's tough to find a spot where to buy because you don't know when you get the hotel room. And without the hotel room, it's tough to, you know, settle yourself and go for buying a SIM card. Because I think it took us like two days to figure out where to buy the SIM card, even though there are a lot of stalls. But I didn't take the chance. I did take the roaming for like seven days, and meanwhile, I managed to buy the Saudi SIM.
[Segment 13] Muhammad: Okay, so I think it's a good idea to get like a roaming SIM initially and then buy like...
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: But not for the whole journey.
Muhammad: Yeah, makes sense, makes sense. Um, so you're talking about maps and location. How important was, uh, one thing is like seeing the map where you are. I think that aspect is covered by Google Map. But how important was location sharing with your other, other like the agency and other people there doing Hajj with you, and how easy it was for you?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, for me, it was something different because I took my mom with me. And my wife was actually looking after her because I cannot go all the places. There is a separation for men and women, of course, understand, except for some of the rituals. So I also use like Apple, but location sharing was the key when you were moving with your agency or the guides, right? And when you have the map, you know, even if you are lost, you can find somewhere, like sharing the address, you know, it's easier to find, right? And even though like the same picture, but with the Google Map, I think it's easier. So, I was thinking, if something, I know I saw a lot of images even in terms of where to move and how the crowd is moving during those days. So, an interactive map, like to give an idea, would have added some value using not only the location sharing because sometimes even if you share the location, it's hard to find. But yeah, it's overall good, but I think if people have a more interactive map, like a Duolingo, they can do their own research, like when to move and how to move from one place to another. That would give them a better idea before going there because a lot of people, that's their first time, like I was doing my first time in Mecca and Medina.
[Segment 14] Muhammad: Okay. So basically, you said like in an app that has a Google Map traffic kind of feature, but traffic instead of traffic, it was more like movement, like where the roads, how people are moving, how things are happening. If you have those information and also, it can, you can use location...
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: What I mean, logistically, we were staying in Azizia, which is not close to the Haram Sharif, right, in Mecca. So what I'm trying to say here, like to give a little bit idea, because logistically, I found it challenging because a lot of roads were closed, right? You know, you also been there for a couple of times, like the road closure and what to do in terms of road closure when you were using the taxi service. When it's not available, you can go for alternative bus service because bus service initially it was quite, I would say, easier compared to the taxi one, even though the taxi is, you know, fast. But for, how can I say, like the Hajj days, like two or three days before the Hajj began, it was too much crowd. And we had a lot of issues with road closure while coming and going back and forth from Haram Sharif to Azizia. So what I'm trying to say, if we knew some information how to manage those interactively with some map...
[Segment 15] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...that would have been better for us because I remember when we went for the first Juma in Haram Sharif, our taxi left us almost 2 km away, and we just followed the crowd to reach there. But we didn't expect it because when we finished the prayer, the group were scattered, and I had a hard time to find my wife. My mom stayed back at the hotel because we thought during the daytime, it was not a good decision to take her in these hot summer days, right? So logistically, that's a preparation. I think if we find a better idea with the interactive map or something informative, that would be great tips, like that might be a section for transportation or logistics.
[Segment 16] Muhammad: So, what do you think? How can we solve it?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: A good idea can come from a great question. So, I mean, I didn't know about the bus service because taxi service from time to time, it might get tough. But I think a lot of people, if they know before and how to use the bus service and how to follow the map, that would have made life easier because initially we were dependent fully on taxi, and sometimes taxi was not available. Even though it was available, it was super expensive. The bus service was super easy, but getting to that, it's not easy. So, what I'm trying to say, if you put some contents about the traffic movement during this time, during the rush time, people would have a better idea, right? So they can better prepare themselves. Okay, if this situation arises, what I can do or how can I face this difficulty? For people who are living far away from the Haram during this Hajj or after Hajj, I think it is better for them to use the bus service because it goes as much as close to the Haram Sharif, saves a lot of hassle finding a taxi and whatsoever. I mean, it's just an idea, like if we can do something or find something in any resource to navigate those.
[Segment 17] Muhammad: Okay. So, I'll share what we are planning to do in this, uh, this course. What we are planning to do, um, is, uh, we are going to use similar service like Google Maps. So, ideally, when people use our service, we ask them to share their location data. So, this is going to act as a GPS, and this is going to be shared with other Hajis, right? So, for example, if people can see like in some area if people are moving slowly, that means it's walking. If there are people moving slowly and some people are moving fast, that means there is a car going on. Then, in terms of bus service, people can tweet and share, like similar to Twitter, people can or Waze people can share information. So, we are focusing on...
[Segment 18] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, like in Google Maps we see, right, when you are driving, it gives you a lot, like the road exposure ahead, or there is a, like...
Muhammad: Exactly, that's something we're planning to do. And also, we are trying to guide the people using content. So, for example, we are telling, if somebody is in Haram and that person is looking for a taxi, we are either telling like, "Okay, you can go to Ajyad corner," or "You can go to Gaza corner," or "You can go to Haram tunnel."
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yes. So that, that was what I'm trying to mention, thank you for, like, you know, shaping it formally. Because we were entering the Haram from different doors, and we didn't know which door we can come out because they are closer, right? So if you put a little bit of idea, like, okay, if you are getting out of gate number 79, this is the closest you can get a bus, or this is the closest you can go to a taxi, right? And if you just give some sort of like picture, the route where to get the taxi or the buses from, because we didn't know before for our mandatory Tawaf that there is a bus stand which actually really works like a shuttle to put you, like the people, in a space where more buses or taxis are available. Because during the prayer time, all the roads, most of the roads, are closed, right? So that shuttle service, we didn't know. So stuff like that, like if you are like the more used places, like as you said, like Ajyad Road or the Khalil Road or Jin? Was it Jin Masjid, I'm not sure.
[Segment 19] Muhammad: Yes, yes. Like there's another place, like the Palestine Road.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, in Palestine, Palestine.
Muhammad: Yeah.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: So there are like a bus stop. We didn't know. We came to realize after we explored and actually we got lost and we had to explore. So stuff like that, like, okay, if you are in this point, this is the closest road to get through, or if you are stuck, you're not finding a taxi, what might be the alternate solution? Because what I found most irritating, it actually killed a lot of time in commuting if I don't know the place. And when I was with the guides, they know how to get out of here, right? Because even if you're with your guide, lots of time you are getting lost, or might be like your path is different. For example, the guide is taking you just for the Tawaf, and they are not allowing you to make any prayer or stay for the prayer. But you decided to stay back and now you're alone. And when you are coming back to your hotel, you are like killing more than two or three hours for commuting, just for a 20-minute drive. So that's a frustrating part I noticed, and due to these information missing, I was not happy.
[Segment 20] Muhammad: Yeah, I actually share my story as well. I was a guide, I was myself a guide in 2024 Hajj, and I, I held Hajj, like I took some Hajis for doing the Tawaf and then planned to come home, and I stayed behind. And then I kind of got on a bus. I was hoping it would go, and then I could not. The bus dropped me somewhere. I had to walk a long stretch of road in hot summer, and I got very dehydrated, and I actually became sick. So even guides, because the road closure and things happen so random, they might not even know. So one challenge to what we're planning to do, implementing, is like incentivizing people. So of course, inshallah, people would like to share this information because it would be a great Ajr, because they are helping themselves and they're helping others as well, and that will make that much easier. Another thing we are planning to do is make this a mutual thing. So, for example, we are giving them live information, and you only get live information when you share your location data. So that means you are getting location data from others, and in return, you are giving your location data back. If you don't share your location, you will not get any insight. Do you think that would be acceptable by...?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I mean, sharing location, I don't think, if people are feeling a different way to share their location, some people might have reservations about that. And I think it should be, since it's a kind of doing beneficial act for others, like a Sadaqa, it should be more easier because some people I saw, they were asking for me, "Hey, brother, please stay with me because I'm not good with maps. So, I'll follow you. I'll hold your hands." I said, "I'm sorry because I have to take care of my mom. I cannot tell or I cannot guarantee you that I can be always with you. It's better to set up the map sharing." But they were not convinced, and they were sad when I told them I cannot be with them forever, because it was my experience, I even lost my wife and my mom sometimes in the crowd, right? So, I mean, I think we should look for an easy one. Even people are not contributing, they can make comments, stuff like that. Because I found a lot of senior people, they are not able to use the map properly. So in the app, if you put like a note section, okay, "I cannot share my, like, both ways, like you can share your location or not," but you can put comments, right? Like, "This is happening in this area, so don't come this way, this road is closed," or stuff like that.
[Segment 21] Muhammad: I see. I see. Okay, makes sense. So it can be like a crowd-sourced stream where people can see what's going on. Um, so that, these are really good insights. Uh, so that covers mostly like the logistical challenges, movement during the Hajj, and you also shared regarding your rituals, you had lots of books. So an app like that would help. You particularly mentioned regarding your mother. I think she doesn't able to have a, um, like a cell phone, but one suggestion I gave you was to take an AirTag. So, do you think giving her an AirTag, she was able to carry and you were able to track her location?
[Segment 22] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, that's exactly what I did. If you remember, we were talking about this because we took the wheelchair from Bangladesh, and also, we are not always relying on the wheelchair. So what I did, we shared AirTags in between us so that each of us can track and follow where our locations are. So that actually helped during our last days when we were doing the farewell Tawaf, we actually lost each other, and the AirTag helped us a lot because I was calling them, they said we are in this side, I was not finding them because the location was not precise in Google. And even the AirTag, it's more approximate, and it helped a lot to track where each of us were. So it helped us a lot, the AirTagging.
[Segment 23] Muhammad: Nice. Nice. Okay. Now, in terms of, uh, like doing traveling around Makkah and Medina itself and doing shopping, seeing the, like, more, uh, like spots. So I know, like, Makkah days were very hectic for you because you went for a short trip. And, um, were you able to visit Ta'if?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: No. Unfortunately, no, this time. Because when we decided to go to Ta'if, in the very beginning, we were busy with our, like, Umrah and other stuff, settling ourselves down there. And when we decided to go there, we were informed there might be road closure, so it might go into vain if we take any attempt. So we actually didn't choose to go to Ta'if this time because, you know, that was a short trip for us. We actually went there just four or five days before the Hajj began. So we were more concentrating on going into Haram or making as much as we could Ibadah in the Haram, making or spending our times mostly in the Haram area. But again, we tried to explore a little bit here, like we went to, uh, what is called, like the Hira Cave.
[Segment 24] Muhammad: Yeah, right. Jabal ar-Rahmah? Is it Jabal ar-Rahmah? Jabal al-Nour.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Jabal [best guess: al-Nour].
Muhammad: Yes.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Jabal [best guess: al-Nour].
Muhammad: Yes.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah. So we couldn't explore Jabal al-Nour. That's another popular spot. But we had an arrangement from our agency, but that was very quick. Just the day before we were moving to Medina, they put everything together. I think everything was in a rush and we avoided that because at that time we stayed in Mina, we had to do our stoning. Same day we had to do our farewell Tawaf, and then same day they arranged for the little tour in the nearby places in Mecca. So we avoided that. So we tried to do some Ziyarah just before the Hajj, and I think we just visited two or three, no, max, I just only one, the Hira one, Jabal.
[Segment 25] Muhammad: And how was the Medina experience, especially with shopping, visiting various gardens?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Shopping-wise, like the place we used to live in, like in Alia, there is a...
Muhammad: No, I mean in Medina market.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You mentioned both of this, like... I mean, to be honest, logistically, it was quite easier to do shopping from Mecca because it was just in front of your hotel, right? And there's a huge market, Souq Salam. But we were advised by the guides and other stuff helping us in the hotel. They said it's better to do shopping in Medina. In Medina, like that, yeah, it's cheaper. You have variety, and you have a lot of bargaining power.
[Segment 26] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: But what happened in Medina, we were more, you know, busy with staying more in the Masjid an-Nabawi. But the most challenging thing was to buy quality dates from Medina. And even though we had a Ziyarah in Medina, we went to, uh, [best guess: Umman], like there was a date farm, I believe. We couldn't buy it from there because our guide told us it's not wise to buy from the farms; it's better to buy from the market. And we explored a lot, and I was asking people where to buy and which item to buy from which market because there are a lot of markets. They're good for items like dates or stuff like that or fruits or whatever, and some are good for, you know, for dresses for both men and women. And there are some special shops or markets for buying costly items. And by the time I figured out, our days in Medina were over, and I had to rush and do some shopping very quickly. So I think it's a good idea if you can add some points like doing shopping, like the most popular spot people can go, like item-wise. Like some people, they're looking for cheap items. I saw a lot of...
[Segment 27] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...shops there, like two Riyals, three Riyals. They're posting outside and most of them are on the Quba Road. It was not like, you have to have a lot of time for shopping, right? And the timing is quite short because during the daytime, if you go out, it's too hot. You have to take it in, and you have to fight with the humidity. It's very low, but the heat is too much. So the only time we got out was after Isha prayer, or sometimes in between Maghrib and Asr. But I think if you put some information in the app that would be easy for people to navigate through, like which market area is good for what item or what they need to. Because I didn't know there was a wholesale market, actually, that was a good thing because I could buy a lot of stuff and save a lot of time, right? But if you're looking for like a customized item, say for example, I was actually looking for a good quality prayer mat, and I saw a lot of Chinese products, and I was confused. And finally, I figured out all of the sources are the same, but you have to know the right place because some places, they're really good. They don't give you the hype, "Okay, this is the best quality." So you have to spend what you get for, right? And some stores, like, they were classy, especially for, I was looking for, like, there was a brother who was my roommate, he said which brand to look for if you're looking for good quality. So that helped me a lot. But if you put it in your app, I think that will help people more so that they have more idea, like the price range, the quality, and stuff like that.
[Segment 28] Muhammad: Okay. So, I think places to, so if we do like places to go for food, what are some of the good things to try?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I didn't explore the food side at all, except like I went for like, uh... No, no, and that was missed completely. I actually had a lot of juice. So, there are a lot of juice bars and stuff like that. And I also had some Bangladeshi flavor tea from one of the Bangladeshi stores in Medina. That was good. And I found out people were enjoying Kalabuna with a lot of various items. So that was mouth-watering. But that was bad timing for me because I just finished my lunch and joined there...
[Segment 29] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...for just a cup of tea.
Muhammad: Okay. So, yeah, that's a good idea because if people want to explore the cuisine, the local cuisine, I think that's a good idea. And also, I know a lot of people, they want to buy gold. And I heard something that encouraged me a lot because some of them are saying there was a new restriction in Bangladesh. And I'm not a big fan of gold, so I didn't have too much. But if you put some information regarding buying golds, where to buy from, like these are all additional, right, appendix of the core items that are helpful, like that saves people time. And I think when you can save time, you can put more effort and more time into Ibadah, where you are actually there for.
[Segment 30] Muhammad: And I think people will pay money for that, right, if it, if it saves people, right? You can make a premium version, "Okay, you have to pay for this secret information if you want to save your time and money."
Muhammad: Okay, so if I want totally your perspective and be honest with me, what do you think should be free for everyone and what can be in the premium version?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: It's tough to say.
Muhammad: I see.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: If I were you, I would put everything for free. But I would definitely see if I'm spending any money for giving any service, obviously, I could charge people for that.
[Segment 31] Muhammad: So, I think if all the things we discussed, like ritual guidance, like Ibadah guidance, logistical guidance, maybe like shopping and then shopping, like sightseeing guidance, like all of them I put and say I charge $15 for one time in a trip. Do you think you would pay for that $15 or that would be...?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: $15 is too much.
[Segment 32] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: People do a lot of Google nowadays, you know, and YouTube YouTubers are there with videos. But I think if you want to make some money out of it, it's better to give them some real value. Like if you can arrange them, or if you give them exact information. For example, we know we can take a shared drive from Masjid an-Nabawi to Quba, but we were scammed by drivers, like the language was the main barrier, right? So I think you can include Google Translate into the app so that people know where you can bargain or where you cannot. Because we also used like 30 Riyals to come back from Quba to Masjid an-Nabawi, and we also spent like two Riyals each person for making the same ride, right? So, I mean, the information is money, and it saves a lot of time. But it's early to say for what purpose you can charge people. For example, if you have an arrangement with an agency who can give you like the tour plan, for example, if they want to explore places around Medina which has historical significance, of course, related to the Seerah and stuff like that, other interesting places, and you have like agency communication, so that way they can save money or get discounts, right? It's mutual, like you see Uber gives you some offers, say buy one get one free, so it's absolutely not free, they're making some money out of it, right? The restaurant, they're not losing any money. They're also making money. So that way, that's something you can explore into. But I'm not sure how the model will look like. But just for the regular information, just helping out people, I think that's a good one. But for premium, I think you have to initially see how it goes and then you can classify what is actually worth paying for.
[Segment 33] Muhammad: Okay. So, if I ask you, what do you think would be a fair price? If I just from your perspective, how much would you be willing to pay for a service like that? It's completely fine if you think, "I don't know, you don't want to pay a dime," that's fine, you can share it.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Sorry, I didn't get your question.
[Segment 34] Muhammad: So I'm asking from your perspective, how much you would be willing to pay for an app like this, and please be honest. If you feel like you don't want to pay a dime for it, that is fine, you can share that as well, but give me an honest answer, how much you'd be willing to pay.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I think if I find it, whatever we discussed here, if everything is there, and it's super interactive and easy to use, I have no issues spending minimum $5 to $10.
Muhammad: I see. Now,
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: But we have to defer the prices for people across the board because some people, they don't want to use the app for a price.
[Segment 35] Muhammad: I see. I see. Makes sense. So, for regional... So for me, like $5, maybe okay. It's okay, $5. But for people living coming from other areas, it might be like $500, right? It might sound, "Okay, it's too much." So, "What I'm actually getting for this $500?" So you have to make it worthy. They said, "No, I paid $500 and it was worth it." So till preparation to the end, if you cover most of the things and make it interactive, like the way you added the Duolingo, like the quiz or interactive preparation, I think those are good points.
[Segment 36] Muhammad: Right, okay, that makes sense. Um, I want to ask you another thing regarding translation and communication. Many people complain about that. So I'll share you two models, you will get which model you like most, right? In one model, it's Google Translate. So you speak and the other person speaks, and what they're speaking is going to be translated to you in English. On the other hand, instead of you directly speaking to them, you talk with an AI that what you want to do, and then what AI will do, AI will speak with a person fluently because AI can do communication right now, and AI will, AI will get the information from that person and AI will just show like a live caption what it is speaking. Is there something different than the Google Translate?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yes, the difference is that in here Google is just translating, but Google is not conversing. You are doing the conversation. But on the other hand, it's not you doing the conversation. You are telling AI to grab you a taxi within, say, example, 10 Riyals, right? And what AI will do, AI will talk with the real person and AI will...
Muhammad: It will continue the conversation.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yes, it will do the conversation.
Muhammad: Wow. In Arabic. Do you think that will make sense for people?
[Segment 37] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, that looks nice and that looks good.
Muhammad: I see, okay, okay. I think, um, that's all the questions I have. Regarding Hajj, I want to end it by asking you two questions. One is after Hajj life. So, for example, if Hajj is more like a community with a group of people. So if you, like, meet people in the Hajj and all of you and your Hajj buddies, they started using the app. Do you think it would be useful for you to have this app for free even after you come from Hajj? So you can see like Hajj memories popped up, you can communicate with them. Um...
[Segment 38] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, I think you can. After Hajj experience or after Hajj, like, follow-up is pretty important. Rather than whatever memory I had, just to, you know, ponder upon the learning that I'm supposed to be on. That's the change that I should be looking continuously for, right? So I was thinking, if there is any way I can follow up, and not only interact with other people or ponder on the memories, but also some activities just to keep myself focused, what I learned from Hajj and how I'm acting upon it. Like, I heard a lot of scholars saying, if you keep doing good work or if you keep doing Sadaqa, stuff like that, so that you are somehow, you know, holding the rope. I'm not sure if I can, yeah.
[Segment 39] Muhammad: And regarding your next step, inshallah, Allah accept your Hajj as my Hajj, and Allah again take you to Makkah and Medina to do Umrah. So if you want to do Umrah, are you planning to go with an agency or are you planning to do it by yourself based on your experience? And come again. So what I said is, if you plan to do Umrah within a few years, do you plan to do Umrah through an agency or do you plan to do Umrah by yourself?
[Segment 40] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Uh, it depends, I don't know. But logistically, I think I'm more informed now to perform my Umrah, and obviously, it will make my journey straightforward, everything under my control. But again, if I choose to go with an agency, I came to know some people, they are doing this journey not only just as rituals, just to have a theme or stuff like that while doing these rituals. Because ritual-wise, it's straightforward, right? Whatever you do, like Umrah or Hajj. But if you don't have the mindset of why you are doing it, of course, it's an Ibadah, like it's one of the pillars, the Hajj. But if you don't see the aftermath, the results in yourself, the changes in your lifestyle or in your thinking, I think that's the biggest gap he will carry forward, right? So I will see how it goes. But to me, it's more challenging to keep the spirit up, being connected spiritually from the beginning to end, and the end is not the end, the end is just another beginning, right? So you have to be like, I mean, I think I need to be more watchful what I'm doing after doing an Umrah Hajj, if there is changing the level of my sincerity in my this world and preparation for the next world.
Muhammad: I see. So, inshallah, if you plan to do Umrah again, and if this app comes in and helps you as a spiritual guidance and gives you a theme, for example, you can choose a theme, like you can take a 15-day Umrah tour, and your theme can be like learning about, say, for example, or if you're doing Ramadan, you want to learn about Tafsir, and within this day, it can give you some lessons, um, it can arrange, it can tell you which part to go, which, um...
[Segment 41] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, I mean, which area I can more focus on, right? Like if I go for Ramadan Umrah, yeah. Or... Yeah.
Muhammad: And you can buy air ticket, everything from the app. I think that would be helpful, right?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I think that's a more extensive idea, right? To add on these like shopping or regarding the logistics information. But the whole idea, I would say, again, just to keep your focus on what is the main purpose, right? Because I was more worried about the logistical part. But after being this year, alhamdulillah, may Allah give them best of the reward to the agency. They made our life easy logistically. Somehow it will be managed, that's my understanding, if you have the proper mental preparation, "Okay, lots of challenges are coming on the way." But the most important thing to me is to keep connected and to revive your spirituality.
[Segment 42] Muhammad: Okay, I want to ask you one thing. We can discuss about lots of things like ritual, then logistics, then after Hajj program, um, then even like booking hotel and air ticket. Do you think if having all of them in one Hajj super app is a good idea, or instead of doing that, is it better to have separate apps, like if you think like Facebook...?
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: What I think, you can have one simple app, but you can have different sections, and those sections could, in itself, be super-duper equipped, right? So you never know, like for people I know, they're going for Hajj or Umrah every year...
[Segment 43] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...so logistically, they know everything. In some cases, they know better than the travel agency how to book a ticket or they know better than the agency how to book a hotel or roam around the city from one place to another. So my idea is, if you give the basic idea, but in a proper way, that will help everyone who's coming, [best guess: irrespective] of this holy journey. So I don't mind having the information for how to book a ticket or whatever. And also, a lot of people, I found, confused, even though they were given information how to pack or how to prepare for the Mina days or for Arafat days or how to be, you know, get prepared for visiting the Rawdah or stuff like that. So in those parts, if you put, like, "Okay, what to keep in mind logistically," and something like spiritually, there's something you can consider. But I don't mind if it's a super equipped app, but it has to be navigated, it should be designed such a way it's in-depth but it's straightforward, concise. It's not too much detail because a lot of people, they get lost if it's super extensive, you know.
[Segment 44] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I mean, you should let people explore themselves if they want to deep dive or if they want to just, you know, know the basic. So that's like a pricing strategy you can put forward. Okay, if you want to deep dive, you have to pay, and if you just want to know the basic, with the basic... For example, like in Hajj, there are in total nine actions you need to do. So those are basic. If you do the nine, you don't need to worry about the other thing. And if you purify these nine things, you have to deep dive. And, you know, there are a lot of scenarios where the Sharia has some space to differ in between madhab or stuff like that. Because I experienced like people are, some people are offering Dhuhr prayer and some people are offering like the Dhuhr regular prayer when the Hajj days. So they're like, you know, that's like another discussion. But what I'm trying to say here, if you want to make it bigger, you can make it robust, but the basic information should be covered. That's the thing. I don't mind having logistics information upfront for me. Because for me, if the logistics are taken care of, I can focus more on the Ibadah.
[Segment 45] Muhammad: Okay, Muhammad, thank you very much for your time. It has been really wonderful talking with you. We learned some valuable insight from you and your perspective. May Allah reward you for your time, and may Allah give you reward of Hajj and also may Allah allow you to do Umrah again.
Mahmud Iqbal Halim: It's all my pleasure, and for your initiative. I believe a lot of people will be benefited in coming days. Like, I got a lot of insights and benefits from your idea, even though it was not in the app mode, like in a fully operational mode. But I pray so that it can be a good one, like people can benefit from, inshallah.
[Segment 46] Muhammad: Okay.

### Interview Notes:

Background Information
• Trip Type(s): Mahmud Iqbal Halim performed Hajj and Umrah.
• Year(s): He completed Hajj in 2025, which corresponds to 1446 Hijri.
• Preparation Approach:
    ◦ He primarily prepared through online classes and recorded videos provided by his agency. He found this to be "a great help to prepare myself, not only logistically, but also...from a spiritual perspective".
    ◦ He supplemented this by asking other individuals who had prior experience with the same agency or Hajj, and by watching specific lecture sessions or videos on YouTube.
    ◦ The agency's sessions were conducted by their guides and scholars to help shape the training for the journey.
Journey / Context
• Planning Tools:
    ◦ Agency-provided lecture sessions and webinars.
    ◦ YouTube for specific topics and questions.
    ◦ Google Translate was a "lifesaver" for communication.
    ◦ Used Apple (devices) for location sharing.
    ◦ Downloaded a manual offline map.
    ◦ Used AirTags for tracking family members (wife and mother), which "helped us a lot" especially when they got lost during farewell Tawaf.
• Agency/DIY Details:
    ◦ He travelled with Shepard Umrah Service, describing them as "pretty professional and very cooperative". They offered sessions prior to registration.
    ◦ For future Umrah, he feels "more informed now to perform my Umrah" independently, noting it would make his journey "straightforward, everything under my control". However, he acknowledges that agencies can help maintain spiritual connection beyond just the rituals.
• Key Milestones / Decisions:
    ◦ Choice of Departure Country: Despite living in Canada with dual Canadian and Bangladeshi nationality, he chose to perform Hajj from Bangladesh. His primary considerations were the custody of his young children (aged five and three and a half) while he and his wife were away, and budget, as Hajj from Canada was "pretty expensive".
    ◦ SIM Card Strategy: Initially, he used a Bangladesh SIM with roaming capability for about a week. After that, he purchased a Saudi SIM package. He found this was a "good decision in terms of communication" because a local SIM "will give you an edge in terms of communication" in crowded areas like Mina or Arafat, and "gives you a lot less headache when you are lost" and need to use a map. He initially relied on roaming because it took him two days to figure out where to buy a Saudi SIM card after settling into the hotel.
    ◦ Navigating Makkah: He found the "mental preparation was the key" to dealing with the logistical challenges, such as "super strict security-wise" checks and "ever-changing" rules, which he was ready for.
    ◦ Sightseeing: He did not visit Ta'if due to a short trip and concerns about road closures. He only managed to visit the Hira Cave (Jabal [best guess: al-Nour]) but avoided a quick tour arranged by the agency due to a conflicting schedule on the day before moving to Medina.
    ◦ Shopping: He was advised by guides to do shopping in Medina rather than Mecca, as it is "cheaper," offers "variety," and provides "a lot of bargaining power".
Pain Points / Challenges
• Custody and Budget: The primary challenges in the planning phase were arranging care for his small children and the high cost of Hajj from Canada.
• Online Training Limitations: Due to a 10-11 hour time difference, he couldn't join live online sessions, leading to the need to ask others or search YouTube for answers to specific questions. He felt in-person attendance might have provided a better understanding or facilitated team building.
• Hesitancy in Seeking Guidance: He observed that pilgrims were often "hesitant to ask questions to the fellow Hajji or even the scholar in that group or even the agency people," who were sometimes unavailable.
• Unclear Religious Guidance:
    ◦ He experienced confusion on minor details of rituals, such as "when to wear the Ihram" or "when to make the Nia".
    ◦ He had to carry "too many notebooks with dua list," distinguishing between recommended and mandatory prayers, which an app could simplify.
• Logistical Issues in Makkah:
    ◦ The overall experience in Makkah was "super strict security-wise," with "a lot of checks and restrictions" and "ever-changing" rules from Saudi authorities.
    ◦ The after-procedures upon boarding in Jeddah were "really tiring".
    ◦ Road closures were a significant challenge, making taxi services difficult to find, expensive, or causing long detours, leading to "too much crowd" and "a lot of issues". He recalled a taxi leaving them "almost 2 km away" from Haram Sharif for Juma prayer due to road closures.
    ◦ He had difficulty finding his wife after prayers when the group scattered.
    ◦ Commuting was time-consuming, sometimes taking "more than two or three hours for commuting, just for a 20-minute drive" due to unfamiliarity with the area and road closures. Even guides can get lost due to random road closures.
• Communication Barrier: He cited the language barrier with drivers as a reason for being "scammed" or overpaying for rides.
• Shopping Challenges in Medina:
    ◦ He found it challenging to buy quality dates and other items due to being "busy with staying more in the Masjid an-Nabawi".
    ◦ He lacked information on "which item to buy from which market," or where to find wholesale markets.
    ◦ Shopping time was limited due to intense daytime heat, forcing shopping primarily after Isha prayer or between Maghrib and Asr.
    ◦ He was confused by the prevalence of "Chinese products" and difficulty in discerning quality for items like prayer mats.
Opportunities / Suggestions
• Interactive Hajj/Umrah App:
    ◦ Comprehensive Ritual Guidance: An app should "keep you in line" by providing step-by-step guidance on rituals, duas (prayers), and what's allowed or not allowed, similar to how Duolingo offers quizzes. It should cover common scenarios.
    ◦ Preparation Materials: Include detailed "preparation materials, I mean, item-wise or action-wise".
    ◦ Mock Tests: The ability to "do like a mock test in an interactive app" would be highly beneficial.
    ◦ Quiz-Based Learning: A "quiz-based learning" approach, similar to Duolingo, with scenarios (e.g., "which dua you would like to make") and small puzzles (e.g., arranging Mina, Arafat in order) would be a "great idea" and an interactive way to learn.
    ◦ Interactive Maps and Logistics:
        ▪ An app could provide an "interactive map" showing crowd movement (similar to Google Maps traffic) to give pilgrims an idea of "where the roads, how people are moving, how things are happening".
        ▪ It should offer information on road closures and alternative transportation solutions, such as bus services, particularly for those staying far from Haram.
        ▪ The app should guide pilgrims on specific Haram gates, nearest bus stops, or taxi stands, ideally with pictures and routes.
        ▪ It should provide "informative" tips like using bus service for those living far from Haram as it "saves a lot of hassle finding a taxi and whatsoever".
    ◦ Crowd-Sourced Information: Implement features allowing pilgrims to "make comments" or share real-time information (e.g., road closures) like Twitter or Waze, even if they don't share their location.
    ◦ Location Sharing: While beneficial, he suggests it "should be more easier" and potentially optional, with crowd-sourced comments as an alternative for those hesitant to share live location.
    ◦ Post-Hajj Features: An app could offer features for "after Hajj experience or after Hajj follow-up" to help pilgrims "ponder upon the learning," interact with others, and "keep myself focused, what I learned from Hajj and how I'm acting upon it".
    ◦ Spiritual Themes/Lessons: For future Umrah, the app could integrate "spiritual guidance" and allow users to "choose a theme," offering lessons and guiding them to specific areas or activities for deeper focus (e.g., Tafsir for Ramadan Umrah).
• Shopping and Food Guidance:
    ◦ The app should include information on "most popular spot[s]" for shopping, item-wise recommendations (e.g., quality prayer mats, dates, gold), price ranges, and quality insights.
    ◦ Suggestions for exploring local cuisine and "good things to try" for food.
• AI for Communication: An AI that converses fluently in Arabic with locals (e.g., taxi drivers) on behalf of the user, showing live captions of the conversation, would be a "great idea" that "looks nice and that looks good".
• "Super App" Concept: He suggests having "one simple app" with "different sections" that are "super-duper equipped" for rituals, logistics, after-Hajj programs, hotel/air ticket booking, shopping, and sightseeing. The app should be "in-depth but it's straightforward, concise," and "not too much detail", allowing users to "deep dive" if they want, but ensuring "the basic information should be covered".
• Pricing Strategy:
    ◦ He would prefer everything to be free if it's general information.
    ◦ He considers $15 for a trip "too much".
    ◦ He believes people will pay if the app offers "real value," such as arrangements with agencies for tours or discounts, similar to how Uber offers work.
    ◦ He states he would "have no issues spending minimum $5 to $10" if the app is "super interactive and easy to use" and includes all the discussed features. He also suggests regional pricing might be necessary.
    ◦ He emphasizes that "if the logistics are taken care of, I can focus more on the Ibadah".
