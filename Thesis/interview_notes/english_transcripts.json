    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: Assalamu Alaikum, Mohid bhai, you've joined. Hello, brother, I can't hear you. Hello? Assalamu Alaikum, brother, can you hear me? How are you? Abdul Muhid: I'll do it from my phone. Muhammad: Yes, now, now I can hear you. Abdul Muhid: Yes, brother, can you hear me? Muhammad: Hello, brother, can you hear me? Abdul Muhid: Yes, I've logged in from two accounts. I wanted to use my PC, but it was giving some trouble, so I've charged my phone and used that instead. Muhammad: Yes, exactly. Muhammad: No problem, no problem, brother. Okay, brother, let's start, Inshallah. Bismillah, Salatu Salam Ala Rasulullah. Let me give you some context, brother. Ever since I went in 2022, I've been trying to do something related to Hajj and Umrah. After that, in 2022, in 2023, what I tried to do was to think about building a Hajj agency management software. The problem is that Hajj agencies are not interested. This is because they have a challenge: their pilgrims' data might be leaked. That's one challenge. Then, for the second option, I thought, okay, if not that, what if we build a portal and show them properly what it's like? Then maybe they might be interested. So, on this occasion, when I went for Hajj with you all, I hired a boy from IIUC Chittagong; he designed a first portal for me. Even after showing that, the main concern remained the same: \"It's not about the pilgrims' convenience.\" But then everyone who saw it gave me feedback saying, \"You should do something like a B2C portal, like Booking.com, where agencies can come and sell packages. We would be interested in that.\" After that, I went with you to the management side, and from the management side, Alhamdulillah, Allah showed me the challenges. Now, my next thought was that if I try to understand the problems that come from agencies, then I should try it manually. That's when he joined as a partner last year, and Alhamdulillah, five pilgrims have gone. So now, I'm planning to work on a complete app. For this, my goal is to interview 30 people so that I can understand what the user's need is and how it can benefit people and where people will be interested in paying, so that it becomes a sustainable app. Because I strongly believe that if Islamic work is always run through charity, it's not a sustainable solution. Inshallah, my request to you is that you speak honestly. If you think something is not useful, please say that too, because otherwise, you might say something nice, but it might not be perfect, and then I might get misguided. Do you understand, brother? Brother, let's start, Inshallah. First, let's get to know you a bit.\nAbdul Muhid: Okay, my name is Abdul Muhid. Professionally, I am a Procurement Officer at a company called Super Engineering. And regarding the purpose for which you are interviewing me, if I speak about its background, Alhamdulillah, Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala granted me the opportunity to perform Hajj with my parents in 2007. Alhamdulillah, I went for Hajj for the first time in 2007. And in 2024, it was Allah's grace; all of a sudden, my father-in-law was supposed to go for Hajj, but by Allah's will, he passed away. So, Allah gave me the opportunity to perform Hajj on his behalf, with my mother-in-law. So, this is my introduction, from the perspective from which you are interviewing me.\nMuhammad: Alhamdulillah. May Allah accept your father-in-law's Hajj. Brother, have you performed Umrah in between? Abdul Muhid: No. I performed Umrah during Hajj; I haven't gone separately for Umrah travel. Brother, let me tell you, you have performed Hajj twice; Alhamdulillah, you have a good experience of Hajj. At the beginning of Hajj, people face many challenges, such as preparation, training, and choosing the right agency. What challenges related to these did you face, and how did you resolve them? Regarding choosing an agency, when I went for Hajj for the first time, I was young, but Alhamdulillah, I was an adult then. I didn't have the choice to pick an agency; my father chose it. However, I can compare the Hajj agency I went with in 2024 and the one I went with [inaudible] Hajj. If I speak from a Sharia perspective, the first time I went for Hajj, the agency followed a certain manhaj [methodology], a type of people who are involved with milad qiyam [religious gatherings] in our country. So, what happens is that when you are with them, they perform the Hajj rituals by flow. But in between, they perform some acts that are like worship but are not really necessary. And these often exhaust people. For example, if I say, like, we have to travel for about four to five hours by bus from Makkah to Madinah and Madinah to Makkah. At that time, they continuously play their nashids [religious songs] or similar things on the bus. So, what happens is that many elderly people want to rest during long bus journeys, but it becomes difficult for them. Compared to them, last time, when I went with the recent agency, I did not face these issues. So, regarding choosing an agency, what I understood is that it's important to know their manhaj [methodology/way] and their experiences, which many pilgrims in our country often misunderstand. Usually, how do people find out about agencies or trust them? Through references like \"my uncle's friend\" or \"my friend's uncle.\" Rather than considering how much support and responsiveness the agency provides to its pilgrims, how well they can solve problems, what their capacity and capability are, and how well-informed they are about Saudi rules and regulations, and how much they can help a pilgrim, people focus on money and relationships. This often leads to difficulties for people once they are there. You have explained it very well, brother. Alhamdulillah. Now, regarding preparation in Bangladesh this time, how did you prepare? Did you take any online courses, or how did you do it?\nAbdul Muhid: I didn't take any online courses like that, but the agency I recently went with, Alhamdulillah, they themselves provided the courses. So, if I were to say, I was mostly dependent on their mentoring or their coaching. Besides that, there are books, of course; reading various books. For example, I benefited from a book by Khandaker Abdullah Jahangir (Rahimahullah) about Hajj. It's a very thin book. I cannot recall the name of the book at this moment. But it's a very thin book, and it contains more logistical information than Hajj's rulings, such as its pillars, arkan [essential components], and farjiyat [obligatory acts]. That is, how I should remain patient when I go to the airport, how my Hajj might be spoiled. So, I also read this book, and it benefited me. And the sessions conducted by our mentors, the guides from that agency, were done, Alhamdulillah. And if I may say a bit about this agency, they actually incur a huge cost for Hajj. Among that huge cost, I saw that the money is given in several installments. Their eagerness was less for the money and more for educating their pilgrims regarding Hajj and its management. So, this aided me a lot. So, online training was not taken in this way, but coaching or training was taken from them.\nMuhammad: Okay, you read books, and you took training from them. Was this in-person, or did you watch recorded videos? Abdul Muhid: J (acknowledging) Muhammad: The training you received from them, was it in-person training or recorded videos? Abdul Muhid: These were live sessions. The agency conducted these at their hall. Now, the agency is actually based in Dhaka, so their trainings were held in Dhaka. Since we live in Chittagong, they used to do live sessions for us on Zoom or YouTube, and later they would provide the recorded videos through WhatsApp groups or other media. So, if we missed them, we could watch them later.\nMuhammad: Now, when you did that training, whether it was on Zoom or watching recordings, was it enough, or do you think there's no substitute for live training?\nAbdul Muhid: Absolutely, I believe live training is definitely necessary. Since I went for Hajj for the first time, meaning I had performed Hajj only once, and I went with [inaudible]. My father had performed Hajj before. So, when it was my first Hajj, it was my father's second Hajj. So, I got my father as a guide then. In many cases, physical training is indeed necessary. I particularly felt this, even if it didn't apply to me directly. But if I talk about our country's culture, many people, especially boys from middle-class families or from villages or small towns, have a goal in life. What can a boy's goal in life be? If he has sisters, he says he must marry off his sisters first, build a house, and then take his parents for Hajj. So, what happens is that their parents might never have left their village. Hajj becomes such a journey for them that it's their first time leaving the village, and that too, to a different country, a different city, and a different environment. In this case, for this, instead of online training, in my opinion, if it's physical training, it's beneficial. Each person's case is different. However, I think physical training is definitely more beneficial than online training. Muhammad: I understand. Now, let's talk about the journey to Makkah and Madinah. You mentioned that when you went to Makkah and Madinah, some incidents happened on the bus that were annoying for you. Now, ideally, you stay in Makkah and Madinah for a long time. You perform Hajj, Umrah, Tawaf, Sa'i. For these, you visit places, you go for ziyarat [visitations]. Agencies take you to some places. Apart from that, when you go by yourselves, self-guided, how confident do you feel doing it? Did you do anything like that, or did you just follow the agency's guidance, whether for Tawaf, Umrah, or for sightseeing? Look, the difference between my first Hajj and my second Hajj is about 10 years, four years, three years, 14 years, almost 15 to 17 years. So, actually, in the Middle East, or specifically Saudi Arabia, and even more specifically for Hajj, their systems are changing day by day, every year. What is the system today might not be tomorrow. So, my two experiences are really different. The first year, we also went sightseeing.\nAbdul Muhid: We did go sightseeing, meaning, we went both times, the first time I performed Hajj and this time too. But your question is whether we can move around independently. So, independently, if I say, we went to Ta'if one day, but that was an issue because the Saudi government now provides Nusuk cards, and we didn't receive our Nusuk card, and unfortunately, the Nusuk card was being delivered on the very day we went sightseeing. The Saudi government, as usual, seemed very sincere for their pilgrims, their guests. They don't allow pilgrims everywhere except for some dedicated buses and dedicated locations, nor do they allow everyone to carry pilgrims. In this case, we went, but we heard that many people, or this year, in the 2025 Hajj, many got stuck in such places, police held them due to some restrictions. So, in this case, we were suggested that either we go with the agency, or if we have to go on our own, we should inform the agency staff. And if I talk about going to and from the Haram, there are often restrictions there too. You need to understand the Haram timings. Perhaps, if you know the specific routes and if their apps or other sources provide information about the rules and regulations, things become easy. However, there are some restrictions specifically for pilgrims. Alhamdulillah, you were there, so you didn't face much problem. Now, do you think an app like this, where, from the beginning, if I say, all the training for Hajj is available? Then there are advertisements for various agencies and verified pilgrim reviews for those agencies. And in that case, after you arrive in Makkah and Madinah, there are details about Hajj and Umrah rituals. Then, if you go somewhere, like Ta'if, Madinah, or the sightseeing places in Makkah or Madinah, their significance is available. Would this actually be beneficial for pilgrims, or is it not very necessary as agencies already cover this? If there is such an app, website, or guide, such a medium, through which I can become independent – by independent, I mean, for example, let me explain with an incident: there was a pilgrim with us, and the person who was guiding us from our agency – it was a dedicated person from the dedicated staff, a brother – I saw him very tense about a pilgrim. What was the reason? Because that pilgrim...\nAbdul Muhid: Yes, he got into an issue with a mobile phone SIM card there. He needed an eSIM, but he purchased a physical SIM, which we usually use, but he needed an eSIM. So, even the agency people were busy with him regarding this. These minor details, which are related to the Hajj journey, if this information is available together, like, \"where do I get a mobile phone?\" or \"where do I go after landing at Jeddah airport?\" – if these are available at a glance in one place, it becomes convenient. Then I don't have to depend on the agency staff for such small matters. In fact, if it also includes information about food, like \"where can I find a good restaurant around Makkah Misflah or Aziziya?\" In fact, another thing I felt, which Alhamdulillah aided me in my environment, but I saw others struggling a bit with it, was language. So, if someone can learn some conversational sentences, or conversational words, some phrases, it becomes convenient for them. In that case, if that app or media also includes this, because I have seen that training usually talks about what is where, but language is not discussed. In such cases, new arrivals are called \"Haji Tariq,\" and they don't understand it, or they can't ask \"how much is this?\" when shopping. They are given various visiting cards, or when they ask someone, \"how did you give this visiting card?\" it's entirely in Arabic. If there are small, not very comprehensive, but some conversational elements, just the minimum necessary, in the training or in that app, I think it would be beneficial.\nMuhammad: Okay, and regarding Hajj and Umrah, if we talk about the rituals, what things do you think would be beneficial if they were available for the rituals? Abdul Muhid: What things regarding rituals do you mean for me? Muhammad: For example, when you are performing Tawaf, first tell me, was Tawaf challenging for you, or was it very easy? And when you were in Mina, Muzdalifah, Arafat during Hajj, were those challenging or very easy for you?\nAbdul Muhid: Okay, if I specifically say, what should be in your media or app, or what kind of aid would be convenient for me or for the pilgrims – is that your question? Muhammad: Yes, exactly. Abdul Muhid: Okay, the challenge I face during Tawaf and Sa'i is entering and exiting the Mataf. Entering the Mataf is usually for men in ihram state, when we went, I don't know the current situation. And it's the same for Sa'i. And there are specific rules and regulations here. For example, Tawaf stops a little before the time for Maghrib prayer. Then some roads are blocked. These issues are present. In the case of Tawaf, if wudu [ablution] breaks, you have to go a long way to perform wudu. You can't find specific routes. Yes. So, if these things are available, like, \"from my current location, where is the nearest toilet?\" or \"nearest wokhana\" [washroom]. There are some washrooms near Mataf. I think if this is available, or if the route to it is available in the app, it would be easy for me, sorry, for the pilgrims, Inshallah. And then, countdown. Many times, people forget whether they have completed two circuits or three, leading to confusion, and they might do an extra one. In this case, if the mobile app has an automatic [counter] - you are engineers, you know how to do it - if it automatically counts one, two, three when you reach a specific place and shows the result, it would be helpful if this could be included.\nMuhammad: If it can be done manually, would that be a problem? Abdul Muhid: Well, for manual, you have to press somewhere. Now, if I accidentally press twice... Muhammad: There will be undo option, you can plus and minus it as you wish. Will that be beneficial, or when you performed Tawaf and you pressed plus once, but accidentally added two, then you can minus one? Why am I saying this? Because, for example, if I make it automatic, hypothetically, the issue is what is it called, like a smart watch, where it shows automatically. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this? Let me tell you, the Mataf area is very crowded. Now, if for some reason it gets pressed and I don't realize it, a specific button or a specific place gets automatically pressed, I haven't seen it. In this case, I might get rukhsat [leniency] from Allah if my counting was wrong. Perhaps a pilgrim might get rukhsat. But I'm saying, if it can be made automatic, then that hassle of counting would be eliminated. This is my suggestion. And if it's manual, then he can count manually with his hand or with a tasbih; there are many manual systems. But there's nothing like automatic, that's why I said it. Manual is available. And another thing I was saying, yes, another thing is wheelchairs. If there is any option in the app to manage wheelchairs or wheelchair related issues. I was saying for Umrah, if there is a system in the app for wheelchairs, at least the pricing should be there. Like, what is the price if I want to hire a wheelchair for Tawaf or Sa'i today? Because there are many types of syndicates or such things, people get cheated. Later they realize, \"I could have gotten this for 70 Riyals, why did I pay 200 Riyals here?\" This can be added. I said this for Umrah. And for Hajj, this time I was added to some groups for Hajj 2025. I know it's Hajj 2025, but I was in some groups that were opened for Hajj. I saw the common problem for pilgrims, of course, that toilets are very crowded and they can't find toilets. So, some of our guide brothers and helpful brothers were guiding us, like, \"Go this way,\" they were sharing maps, \"There's a toilet here, if you want to eat, go this way, there are shops here.\" And many pilgrims lost their tents. And these brothers found their tent numbers and names, tracked the tent, and showed them the map. So, if these can be included, especially if the routes can be included, I think it would be easier for pilgrims in their tasks.\nMuhammad: Mashallah. Creating a Hajj map is very crucial, right? Inshallah, Inshallah. Abdul Muhid: So, Hajj and Umrah are covered, but your point seems to be that rituals and du'as can be read from books. Would you feel comfortable reading from an app? If a dedicated app for Hajj is made, then Hajj du'as and other rituals will definitely be there, I'm assuming that by default. But even if they aren't, there are enough other resources for that. The real hassle of Hajj, from what I observed among pilgrims, is that pilgrims usually practice du'as – what to say where, what to say when starting Tawaf, what to say after finishing Sa'i. They practice these. Pilgrims usually prepare for Hajj, though some may not. But usually, they do. However, I have seen that when they go there, people struggle with managerial and logistical issues, especially those from our country who travel less. As I said, especially during the Hajj season, people go from small towns or villages, or middle-class people go. Many have a dream of performing Hajj in their lives. For them, these things become a bit difficult, as there isn't such a book available that would have such a guide. So, in my opinion, if it's specifically for Hajj, then okay, it can be included. But if du'as are not included, I don't think it would affect much. Muhammad: Brother, now tell us about the day of Arafat. Arafat is a day of du'a. Do you think you were able to pray with your heart fully in Arafat, and if so, what advice would you give others? Were you able to pray wholeheartedly in Arafat, and if you were, what advice would you give others so that they can do the same?\nAbdul Muhid: I don't know if I can answer this question very well. Alhamdulillah, I was able to ask from Allah, what is called talking to Allah, and praying with an open heart or wholehearted prayer, I don't really know what that means. However, I was disturbed in one place. I mean, I was trying to go outside and pray, and I saw a gentleman praying very loudly, making a lot of noise, reciting something by looking at it, which disturbed me a bit. So, in that case, I actually stopped right there and didn't go anywhere else. For Arafat du'a, in this case, if someone asks for advice, I would say it's best to spend that entire day in du'a. For instance, if there's any disturbance somewhere, moving away from there to a place where there is less disturbance or where one can concentrate and pray, I think that would be better. Satan gives some waswas [whispers], which I also experienced or tried to share. That is, like, I am used to certain behaviours and things, we all are, not just me. But in Hajj, some things need to be sacrificed. If I say, I am used to using a certain type of toilet, I am used to certain type of bedding. Now, it is seen that when we go for Hajj, the standard packages we take, the standard tents we are given, the toilets around those tents are probably not like the ones we use in our homes. And then, if I expect my toilet to be a certain way, or my bed to be a certain way, and I don't get that, it becomes difficult. Perhaps, to avoid using the toilet, I held it in. But this will affect my du'a, that I'm holding in my toilet, but I can't pray. Or I couldn't sleep because I didn't find a place, so I stayed awake, but that lack of sleep is affecting my du'a. So, we should try to let go of these things. We should try to rest the body as much as needed. The way I got the bedding, I should take as much rest as needed within that. Then, the toilet too, as it is. I'm just talking about toilets and sleep here, but many other things can come up, maybe food, maybe the people around.\nAbdul Muhid: ...Or the people around. Yes, whom I might want to talk to right now, I'll sacrifice that conversation for one day. So, like that, just focusing on the du'a and managing other things as best as possible, then I think it will be better because Allah will accept du'a on that one day, Inshallah. Muhammad: Okay, so, what you're saying, brother, if you want a summary, is that sometimes many scenarios arise that take us out of our comfort zone. To prepare people for these things, can we do something like having reminders or constant reminders? Perhaps a reminder section in the app, where everyday some motivational verses come through the app, and Allah says that remembrance of Allah softens our hearts. If there's something like a live stream during Hajj, where inspirational quotes from various Sheikhs are coming, and you can connect with other pilgrims, if you feel down for some reason, you can share it in a group where other pilgrims support and encourage you – if something like this can be done, would a support group, an Islamic support group where pilgrims support each other with motivational du'as, be beneficial then?\nAbdul Muhid: This would be beneficial. In this case, something came to my mind, Alhamdulillah, Baraka Allahu Feek. What often happens to me, regarding reminders, is that I wonder, \"What du'a should I make now?\" For example, I pray for myself. If I pray specifically, I might have a specific problem. Someone might have debt, or a child might be sick, or they themselves might be sick, or they might have financial issues, blah blah. If these can be reminded, if it can help to list them – like, you provide a du'a note, and there are some options for general du'a, for self, \"what are the necessary du'as for me? What should I ask Allah for? Should I ask for my illnesses, for financial concerns?\" I ticked, ticked, ticked, and it became a list in one place. Okay? Then I'll pray for my father. For what du'a for my father? My father has hand pain, leg pain, eye operation, blah blah blah. I selected these, and they also came to one place. In this way, I custom-made my du'a, I had a du'a list from home, and I custom-prepared it there. After preparing, if this note comes up when I forget to pray at that moment, then I think it would have been beneficial for me, for Abdul Muhid, if such a thing existed. Because in Saudi Arabia, carrying pen and paper to write it down and keep it with me – I always carry my mobile, right? I always carry my mobile, and even writing it down on my mobile, I was a bit hesitant whether to write it on my mobile or not. But now I think, if someone had provided such a note, if it was in an app, I would look at the app and think, \"Oh, this was my du'a,\" or \"This du'a was done this time, next, I will pray for this.\" If there was such a reminder system, I think it would be beneficial for me if I had it. I can't really speak for others, brother.\nMuhammad: Okay, in this regard, what we've done in our app, \"Kone Din\" (the one I told you about), is that there's a blank slate for du'as, where you can add du'as as you wish. And we're also working on another chat engine. It's still in preview mode, so very strong guardrails haven't been added yet; we haven't released it to the general public. But what it does is, if you talk to it, it will craft du'as for you. For example, it might ask you to share something. You might talk about your father, your family, you might talk about Jannah [Paradise], or the Muslim Ummah [community]. Then it will take those things and search whether the Prophet (peace be upon him) made any similar du'as. If he did, it will first bring up those du'as. If not, then what it will do is, okay, if there's no such du'a, then it will identify which of Allah's names are associated with the acceptance of that du'a. For example, if you want something related to sustenance, like you want a beautiful child, or you want a good job, then it will bring up Allah's names like Al-Razzaq (the Provider), Al-Hadi (the Guide), Al-Mujib (the Responder). It will bring these special names. And then, to further craft your du'a, it will praise Allah a lot in the du'a, add salawat [blessings upon the Prophet], ask you what good deeds you have done, and add those good deeds as a means (wasilah) to Allah. It will formulate a du'a for you, just like we use AI to write an application or a blog. In the same way, so that we can make du'a to Allah in very beautiful language, showing respect to Allah. It will craft the du'a for you in this way. Do you think pilgrims would benefit from having such a tool?\nAbdul Muhid: You are saying that, regarding what you mentioned, about sustenance. And about Allah's name being related to it, that from hadith it is one of the ways to ask from Allah by using Allah's names. Yes, I think it would be better and beneficial if this is included, Inshallah. Here's one thing I'd like to share: when people use apps or try to do something, sometimes the core of worship gets lost. For example, you might be connected with me, but when you're constantly looking at an app or doing something, your mind might get distracted. So, in that case, do you think it can cause distraction, or if not, can we limit its use, or should it be given free form for use? Muhammad: You didn't understand 'free form'. Abdul Muhid: Free form means the pilgrims will use the app as they wish, and limited means the pilgrims can use the app, but there's a daily limit so that they don't get distracted, and pilgrims can set that limit themselves. The thing is, in this case, may Allah forgive me, but if someone gets distracted, it can happen due to many things. There are many reasons for distraction. Now, if you want to benefit from something useful, and it causes distraction, then you need to compare the distraction and the benefit, what the percentage is. Then I think it's easier to make a decision. And this is not mandatory. You can use it as is. Oh, are you asking if 'free' means no subscription fee? Or do you mean, will you use it as you wish, or if the app feels you are using it too much? For example, on the day of Arafat, it sees you are constantly active on the app, not praying. Perhaps it sees you are watching what other people are requesting for du'a. Then you start playing with the app aimlessly. In that case, should it start warning you? Would something like that be good?\nAbdul Muhid: Okay, yes, that would be good. If they use the phone excessively, that can happen. But if they are genuinely using the app. Like, I'm praying for two hours with the help of the app. Now, if the app tracks that he's on the app for two hours, it means he's working on the app. In this moment, giving a warning is actually [inaudible]. But if the app has an option where it detects that he's visiting another entertainment site or social site more than the app itself, if a warning goes in that case, I think that would be more beneficial. My point is, I can use this type of app all day in Arafat, like a book. In this case, how much is the warning actually [inaudible]? And what you're saying about distraction, brother, in the field of Arafat, people get distracted even by food and drink, they get distracted by washrooms, they get distracted by umbrellas. If there is a tendency to get distracted, they will be. This will be a good deed, Inshallah.\nMuhammad: I understand. Now, let's move to the final point, brother. Do you think people would be willing to pay for this kind of app, or should it be included with the Hajj subscription fee, or would people be willing to buy it separately? Abdul Muhid: I live in Chittagong. I live in Chittagong city. Chittagong is a part of Bangladesh. My observation is that people expect things to be free as much as possible; I saw a high expectation for free things. However, the current generation, the new generation, if I speak more specifically, the age group from 18 to 35-40, a portion of them spend on technology. They spend on technology, like some spend on OTT apps, some spend on gambling, some spend on games. So, I see them spending. However, I cannot specifically say whether they would spend in such spiritual matters. But if I speak from my perspective, my personal opinion is that I probably would not purchase it, meaning I probably would not take a paid subscription if I were asked. And I might be saying this now, but my decision might change during Hajj. Like, if I can spend 8 lakh or 10 lakh Taka to go for Hajj, why wouldn't I spend 1000 Taka to make my Hajj a little better? I might think that way then. Perhaps my perspective might change then.\nMuhammad: I understand. So, you can't really say right now. Most likely you wouldn't, but if it's genuinely good, has high reviews, and people benefit, then maybe you would try. Abdul Muhid: Yes, yes. Muhammad: Okay, Mohid bhai. So, these were mainly your questions. I'll just conclude with one thing. After Hajj, after you've returned from Hajj, do you think if there's any app or something, it could be extended for the post-Hajj period, like having a community of people who performed Hajj together, to stay connected with them, or to remind them of any pledges made during Hajj? Or do you think the app's activities should end after the Hajj period?\nAbdul Muhid: Definitely, for those who truly love Hajj, who truly feel Hajj – I can't speak for everyone, but I wish that conversations about Hajj continue always. Like, \"I went here,\" \"I was walking in Misfalah,\" \"I went to Haram tonight.\" Staying lively in this kind of conversation always. Keeping the memory of going to Arafat lively. This is what I want for myself, and I see this in most of the people who were with me as well. That this should remain, the essence of Hajj should remain even after Hajj. I've found this in the majority of people; they want it to stay.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, Mohid bhai, thank you very much for your time. May Allah grant you a Mabrur Hajj. May Allah grant your father-in-law the reward of a Mabrur Hajj, Inshallah. Jazakumullahu Khairan. Inshallah, I will share updates with you later. Abdul Muhid: Inshallah, you definitely will. And please forgive me. Perhaps I have used too many words, too many sentences. Maybe I spoke unnecessarily in response to your questions, perhaps what could have been said in a few words or two sentences, I made it quite long. If there are any mistakes or shortcomings in my communication, it is from my side and from Shaytan. And if there is anything beneficial in my words, it is certainly from Allah. I...\nMuhammad: Alhamdulillah, and we seek refuge from Shaytan. Muhammad: Alhamdulillah. The conversation was very beneficial, and we gained many good insights. Jazakumullahu Khairan, Barakallahu Feek. Abdul Muhid: Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh. Muhammad: Wa Alaikum Assalam wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh."

    "english_transcript": "Key Takeaways from the Interview:\n• Customer Acquisition: Imran's primary sources for customer leads are personal referrals, his Facebook group where he is an admin, and WhatsApp. He currently does not have any other significant sources and relies on leveraging these existing channels for growth. He also states that he doesn't have any sub-agents and directly collects clients.\n• Business Model & Challenges:\n    ◦ Imran works primarily as an individual sales partner for a Dhaka-based agency called Shepherds, who handle all the backend operations while he focuses on collecting pilgrims.\n    ◦ He aims to establish his own full-fledged agency within the next three years, where he would purchase services directly from providers.\n    ◦ Core challenges include:\n        1. Licensing for his own institution.\n        2. Adapting to constantly changing rules and regulations from the Saudi government.\n        3. Changing mindsets and behaviors of pilgrims.\n        4. Trust-building with direct hotel sourcing from Makkah or Madinah, as he lacks trusted contacts there, a role currently fulfilled by Shepherds.\n        5. Lack of direct service organization from potential Saudi sources for pilgrims' needs.\n    ◦ He is interested in B2B rates from validated travel providers, especially if they provide good service with booking reference numbers and if there are strong reviews from trusted sources.\n• Operational Approach & Costs:\n    ◦ Imran adopts a lean approach to his operations.\n    ◦ His primary costs are related to his marketing efforts and occasional boosting, not actual office maintenance.\n    ◦ He estimates that acquiring a single customer requires approximately 15 hours of his time, including calls, meetings, and digital marketing.\n    ◦ His current tools for customer management and agency relations are Facebook and WhatsApp, which he finds sufficient for his current operational level.\n• Technology & AI Integration:\n    ◦ Imran is exploring the use of AI tools like ChatGPT to support his marketing efforts and improve operations.\n    ◦ He currently uses the free version of ChatGPT but plans to get a paid version, specifically for his Hajj and Umrah business.\n    ◦ He would consider a dedicated AI service specifically trained for the Hajj and Umrah market (like a specialized ChatGPT version) only if it offers tangible extra benefits or solutions that ChatGPT cannot provide, as he finds ChatGPT sufficient for his general tasks."

    "english_transcript": "Interview Transcript\nMuhammad: This meeting is being recorded. Uh, Jamael bhai. Uh, thank you for your time to um, like, allow us to interview you. Uh, just to confirm, you are within the age group of um, 35 to 45 and right now you reside in Germany, right?\nJamael Tanvir: Um, I mean, I'm in the age group of 35 to 40, I would say, and I'm currently residing in Germany. Yes.\nMuhammad: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um, so, uh, as per my knowledge, you have performed Umrah in uh, 2020, Hajj in 2022, and Umrah in 2023. Afterwards, have you uh, performed Umrah yourself?\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, yes, I uh, went uh, for Umrah last year as well. Um, so yeah, so there was another time that when I went for.\nMuhammad: So last year when you went by yourself, have you went by an agency or you booked everything by yourself?\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, I did it by myself.\nMuhammad: I see. I see. So how did you buy everything? Did you use a portal like Booking.com, Agoda.com, or you uh, got it uh, from a like agency and they just bought it for you based on your schedule?\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, actually, I booked it through Check24.de. So it's very popular in Germany. Uh, I mean, it is uh, used for many different purposes. Uh, hotel booking is one of them. Uh, and this Check24 also has connection with Booking.com, Agoda.com. Uh, I mean, they have the partnership with them. So if you search for some hotel, if that is not listed in Check24, then they can also search those uh, listings from Booking.com or similar similar uh, websites and list them into Check24. So it's very uh, you know, intuitive for users. So that's why it's very popular in Germany and that's what I used actually. And for visa processing also, I did it myself. Uh, I just went to the uh, so the visa portal and then applied for it.\nMuhammad: Okay. Now um, you don't have, you have a Bangladeshi passport which, which requires uh, people to have Umrah visa. So, did, does it uh, work in that way or you are able to do Umrah with regular Saudi travel visa? Which one did you choose?\nJamael Tanvir: I, I actually applied for uh, travel visa that is um, uh, valid for one year and uh, also multiple entry possible. But when you uh, apply for visa, you can also mark that you want to perform Umrah. So that's what I did. Uh, and since I have um, uh, uh, the residence permit in Germany, so it also helps to get the visa easily.\nMuhammad: I see. It makes sense. Makes sense. Um, so how was the um, you say like the booking experience was really good, like it was very seamless, right, from the website?\nJamael Tanvir: It was seamless. I mean, seamless in a sense that uh, um, the availability of hotels was uh, not an issue, but one issue I faced is uh, with the price. So if, I mean, I wanted to uh, find a hotel close to Kaaba uh, and when I searched for it, I found that the uh, price is a bit high on the high side. So, it was a bit difficult to find a hotel within my budget. That's one issue I faced.\nMuhammad: Do you remember sharing which month you went uh, for the Umrah?\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, yes, I, I went there uh, uh, in the beginning of December last year.\nMuhammad: I see. Early December is one of the most busy months. So I think that's maybe one of the uh, reasons. Um, so how was, and what kind of hotel you ended up booking? I think it's a, it's a three-star hotel. Um, it was pretty close to Kaaba, but uh, I mean, uh, alhamdulillah, it was uh, uh, more or less within my budget.\nMuhammad: I see. Uh, did you walk to um, Kaaba from the hotel?\nJamael Tanvir: Yes, it was, you know, within the walking distance.\nMuhammad: I see. And how was the service? Like, it advertised as three-star, but have you found the service is three-star or you feel service might not be three-star standard?\nJamael Tanvir: I mean, I mean, the service was uh, um, on par, I would say. I mean, I was not expecting much uh, from the hotel as well, but uh, overall, the um, quality was uh, I would say, good. I mean, considering it's a three-star hotel, also the staffs were very uh, you know, uh, very helpful and um, respectful, so which uh, I liked actually.\nMuhammad: I see. I see. So you landed in the Jeddah airport and then went to the hotel, correct?\nJamael Tanvir: Yes.\nMuhammad: So how was the commute from Jeddah to the hotel?\nJamael Tanvir: Um, the commute was fine, but uh, one um, challenge was to find uh, uh, a transport. I mean, um, there are a lot of uh, taxis available, but if you want to take a taxi, it's very, very expensive. Um, so I was actually looking for a cheaper option, and and you will also find a lot of um, you know, private cars, private cars, the who actually uh, you know, take people uh, from airport to the hotel, which is not legal uh, in a sense uh, that uh, the Saudi government actually uh, does not uh, you know, uh, how would I say, um,\nJamael Tanvir: I mean, it, I mean, it's not, I, I would say it's not allowed, but it's regulated. I mean, if they find out, they will definitely uh, uh, I mean, take some action against the against the owner of the car. Uh, so that's the from that perspective it's not allowed, but they do not usually uh, you know, bother much, but yeah, I mean, these options are there, so I took uh, one of these options actually to go to hotel from airport.\nMuhammad: So how was your haggling experience? So when you started, when they quoted a price, do you have an idea that what was a fair price or you used your intuition to haggle?\nJamael Tanvir: Um, so I asked other people who used this service before, uh, and based on that I got some idea, and obviously when we ask that I will go to this hotel, this area, uh, they will ask for more money. Then uh, I had to bargain and um, then we came to an agreement that, yeah, we will, uh, I will pay this amount, and then uh, they agreed, and then we started. That's how it went.\nMuhammad: Uh, okay, makes sense. Um, have you considered riding the train?\nJamael Tanvir: Train uh, was uh, in my mind to be very honest, but I didn't take the train for one reason, because I had a lot of luggages. Because uh, so uh, the Jeddah airport was kind of a stopover for me, because I was after, after performing Umrah and staying there for four days, I uh, went to Bangladesh. So I basically came with a lot of luggages. So one problem I thought is that after uh, you know, reaching the uh, Makkah station, I still have to find some transportation to go to hotel because I cannot um, like, for, for example, take a, take a bus to uh, reach somewhere and bus would uh, leave me somewhere uh, far from the hotel. So I still have to walk to the hotel. So this is why I thought that if, if I can take a car, then I can directly uh, reach to hotel. And then it would be easy to, easy for me to carry the luggages, which is why I didn't take the train.\nMuhammad: I see. So, if you don't have luggages, then you would have taken the train; that makes sense.\nMuhammad: Okay. So, in terms of sightseeing into Makkah and also doing shopping and food, you have been there a couple of times, so you know all the places that are there. But, do you think someone who goes for the first time would benefit from an app that tells them where all the popular markets are and where some of the good places to eat food are? Do you think something like that would help?\nMuhammad: I think that would help a lot. I mean, someone who hasn't traveled to Jeddah or Makkah has no idea where to find what. It's a puzzle, in my opinion, this area around Kaaba. It's very difficult to find hotels, find routes to go to Haram, and find restaurants to eat, and also shopping, etc. It's actually very difficult and it's kind of a puzzle if someone is going there for the first time. But once someone goes there and roams around, maybe after that they will get some experience, but the first time it's very difficult. So, if there is something or some apps which will help to go to certain locations for certain things, obviously that will help a lot.\nMuhammad: Yeah. Uh, that's fine. Uh, so for example um, I think uh, if uh, we show um, like we ask people what kind of food they want to eat and then uh, we will prescribe some places with high budget, more like a high budget. For example, somebody wants to eat maybe uh, Pakistani curries, that we can show like, like a cheaper option and also like a better option where it's like inside a mall, things like that. And also for like shopping, we want, we ask them what are some of, some of the things in your shopping list, and we can show them all the markets from there that they can buy, and we can also give them review of other people, what they feel like shopping experience from those particular market. Um, do you think uh, that would be a right approach to integrate into the app or if you have other ideas?\nJamael Tanvir: No, I think, I think this is a good idea. Uh, for example, filtering uh, the cuisine would be uh, one of the best options, because there are many people who actually cannot, can't uh, cannot uh, you know, uh, uh, taste different cuisines from different countries.\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, especially there are many Bangladeshis who cannot actually eat anything other than Bangladeshi food. So, uh, it's important for him to find some Bangladeshi restaurants around the Haram area, and not all of them are, you know, uh, very visible from the public space. So if the app can give this filtering option, that will definitely, definitely help. And also in terms of shopping, especially if uh, someone wants to buy uh, dates, for example, uh, they definitely, he definitely needs to find the right place to buy the dates because uh, the shops near the Haram area, they are very expensive and they may not be the fresh, uh, the fresh dates may not be available there. So uh, if the app can actually provide some information regarding this, obviously it will help a lot.\nMuhammad: I see. I see. No, that makes sense. In terms of sightseeing, right? I think, I think when people want to uh, visit Makkah and Madina, they also want to do sightseeing. Uh, they want to visit various places in Madina that have linked to historical ties and also various places to Makkah that have linked historical ties. Right?\nMuhammad: So there are many uh, such places that have authenticated narration, like this place is famous for this, and there are many places that have like, like fabled narration, so people say so when such and such happened, but it's not verified by Islamic um, historians. So do you think if we can create an itinerary place uh, based uh, like exploration plan for people where people can see what are some of the places they can go in Makkah and outskirts of Makkah, like Taif, uh, in various mountains of Makkah, uh, like famous spots for uh, Hajj, and same for Madina, and it has like an uh, audio video overview that is uh, telling why certain places are famous, so people can arrange uh, self-guided tours. Um, do you think such a thing would add value towards people or people generally able to find it by themselves or by group?\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, I think it's a good idea to have this kind of information in the app uh, itself. Uh, and you are correct that uh, this information is not readily available and there are different uh, narrations, different stories about different places. Um, uh, people would not generally find them uh, by themselves. Uh, it's uh, it's a good idea to provide this information in the app.\nJamael Tanvir: But I would also suggest one thing: if it's possible to uh, connect some uh, travel guide or travel agency, I, I don't know exactly how to say it in terms of um, uh, in terms of uh, this sightseeing. So if uh, it's possible to connect some um, travel agencies within Saudi Arabia who can actually take to places which are authentic based on Islamic history. Uh, that would actually help the, help the Hajis to, you know, uh, follow and uh, and um, understand. Maybe, if, maybe uh, it can be uh, something uh, for the next steps, but I would uh, highly suggest to uh, you know, consider this.\nMuhammad: I see. No, that's, that's very great advice. Uh, now in terms of uh, preparation for Hajj and Umrah, like as you went to Hajj as your first trip, obviously you were trained on how to do Hajj and how to do Umrah. Now do you think this training can be done online both for Hajj and Umrah prior to uh, the trip, maybe three months prior? You will have like an on-demand uh, video uh, like and audio-visual course that uh, you can see in your free time, but it also has a schedule that it will guide you that um, module by module that you need to finish uh, within three months for a self-learning um, so that you get more prepared uh, for Hajj and Umrah um, both logistically and spiritually. Do you think such a course would add value to the pilgrims?\nJamael Tanvir: It's very important. I, I can actually share my experience regarding this. Uh, first of all, someone who is intending to go for Hajj or Umrah, I mean, it's always better to have some um, training in person. For example, uh, when I went for Hajj, my agency actually did a uh, you know, how do I say um,\nMuhammad: One day, like day-long training session, right?\nJamael Tanvir: Day-long training session. And it, it happened actually multiple occasions, not only just one day, but it happened multiple occasions on different topics. It actually helped a lot to learn and understand things about Hajj and Umrah. But when it was about time to leave for Makkah, uh, I was still uh, in kind of a panic situation, a panic uh, mode that uh, am I, am I going to do it properly or am I going to make mistakes? So I was actually looking for tutorials online. For example, how to wear Ihram, uh, that was one of the challenges for me. Uh, because it was my first time. So I was uh, looking for videos how to perform uh, uh, sorry, how to wear Ihram, uh, and I was uh, looking into many videos. And many different videos, the brothers or the people who were uh, showing the way of wearing, they were different. I mean, there are obviously different ways to wear. So I, I found different uh, different videos and and it was giving me different ways. So I was also getting a bit more confused because I was also trying those different ways to wear Ihram, um, I was also getting confused.\nJamael Tanvir: So if, if an app that can give me uh, a comprehensive uh, training course, that will help me in a sense that I don't have to look for it in different places. For example, YouTube. Uh, and I can, I can just go, it, the app can become my go-to companion to find whatever I need. So, for example, if I need to uh, check the videos how to uh, wear Ihram, I just go there and check it. Uh, if I need to uh, know how to uh, perform Tawaf or Sai, I can just go there and uh, check it. So that will definitely help as, as a first-timer at least. Obviously, if I go there multiple times, uh, it will still help because something, for example, is not done regularly. So, uh, I tend, as a, as a, as a Haji, I will uh, forget after some time how to do it. So it will definitely help me uh, brush up my memory and then uh, uh, you know, just uh, uh, get myself prepared for this.\nMuhammad: Okay. Um, great. Now in terms of uh, authenticity, uh, uh, do you think um, like having like a certification from uh, Islamic institution would be enough or do you want the lecture to be delivered by a renowned Islamic uh, teacher? So uh, but in my opinion, it, it's uh, it's a gray area, I would say, gray area in a sense that people uh, have different uh, different, I mean, people come from different uh,\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, sects, uh, by sects, I mean, the different school of thoughts.\nMuhammad: Yeah.\nJamael Tanvir: So uh, naturally they have different ways of performing things. I'm only considering Bangladesh uh, when I'm talking about this uh, and someone, for example, who follows Hanafi, he's very strict about it and he does not follow anything else or he does not want to follow anything else. So, uh, I think from that point of view, it would be better if the app can provide uh, you know, rulings from different school of thoughts.\nMuhammad: I see.\nJamael Tanvir: So that the user can choose which one he wants to listen to. Uh, obviously it has to be backed by uh, Quran and Sunnah for sure. No doubt about that. But since uh, I mean, the school of thoughts are prominent, I uh, it would be better to uh, have content from different school of thoughts just to uh, you know, uh, have the flexibility for the user to choose uh, which one he wants to listen to or read to.\nMuhammad: I see, you know, that makes sense. Um, now in terms of during Hajj and Umrah, I think um, like you saw like our app, what do you think like having this like checklist style app? Would it be helpful?\nMuhammad: Uh, checklist of what could be, the app I just showed you right before the call, like the mobile app, yeah. Do you think such an app would be helpful where all the steps and all the action items are there?\nJamael Tanvir: Definitely, definitely, that would help. For example, uh, I, I checked the Umrah guide which is like uh, an action um, guide which is, which I really liked. Um, so for example, when we are doing Tawaf, it's very easy to forget how many laps I did. So if I have a counter, that would definitely, definitely help um, not to uh, not to be bothered about the count. So and I can uh, I can actually concentrate on making duas, so that will definitely help.\nMuhammad: I see. Now regarding the app, one of the things people complain that uh, two things, right? First of all, they feel like one of the main problems with the app is sometimes it creates lots of distraction, because example, you are off and all sorts of random notifications started coming. And second problem people said, uh, some, when it is very rush, then uh, following an app is very difficult because your phone might break, like you might lose, lost your phone and stuff. What's your suggestion? How do you think we can mitigate those challenges? Um, one thing that, that's come uh, that's coming to my mind right now is uh, uh, integrating a watch app with the, with the main app.\nJamael Tanvir: So that uh, the uh, Haji does not need to uh, open the phone. He can keep it uh, in the, in his belt, for example, and from watch he can follow everything.\nMuhammad: It would be very easy. I see. Um, also I think it can have connection towards Bluetooth and um, it can take certain voice commands. So for example, if the Haji wants to get reminded about uh, certain dua regarding family, it can tell you what the duas that need to be there. Or if Haji asks like uh, when Haji feels like finish a Tawaf, it can just notify the app like, \"finish Tawaf\" and it can report. So just using AI like a Tawaf component. Do you think that would create more noise or it would add easiness for Hajj?\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, so it uh, it depends in my opinion. I mean, if I want to do too many things, it might get uh, a bit tricky. Uh, so let's say if the watch gives you, I mean, I, I as a user give a command to the watch, and let's say I want to uh, listen to some dua, for example, because watch would not be uh, the right place to read the dua because it, it doesn't have enough space. So the, what's the solution? Solution is that it will play the dua. Uh, but when it's noisy, when it's very uh, you know, the traffic, I mean, the crowd is very big, it might be a bit difficult to uh, hear the uh, dua. So that's one problem I can see uh, in that, in that case. But uh, if I just want to keep it minimal, for example, I just want to keep track of my laps um, and and what else?\nMuhammad: Maybe some uh,\nMuhammad: Duas that you want to make, some reminder regarding the dua.\nJamael Tanvir: Exactly. Uh, maybe it can remind me some duas that I already know. Uh, that might, might be helpful. And also since watch has, usually the smartwatches have GPS, the GPS can already track the laps by itself.\nMuhammad: Yeah. I think the main problem with that uh, because people are uh, like, it's not fairing in a so small um, area, the slightest error might create a false positive uh, nuance, and I think this is too risky to introduce that.\nMuhammad: That's true. So that is one reason we are trying to avoid like an automated one. Um, it can be semi-automated, it can suggest that, okay, have you completed a lap and then user can tap yes or no, something like that. But I think completely relying on GPS might be a problem. Um, correct. Right. I agree. Um.\nMuhammad: So regarding the dua module that you have seen, like it's like a blank state, right? But one of the main things that people do in Hajj and Umrah is dua, right? Like there are lots of stories that people made dua in Hajj, they made dua in Umrah, they made dua in certain places in Arafah which get uh, accepted by Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala, right? And but many people complain like they have nothing to make dua about. Right. So how do you think a module can help? Right? So it will help people to juggle their mind and bring all the duas in front. How do you think something like that can help?\nMuhammad: Um, it definitely helps. For example, when I perform Tawaf, I usually uh, I usually um, follow this application uh, uh, what's the name, the Sunnah Duas um,\nMuhammad: By Green Tech, right?\nJamael Tanvir: Sorry.\nMuhammad: By Green Tech app, you meant?\nJamael Tanvir: Yes, yes, exactly. I mean, this is very, I mean, uh, it's, it actually comes as a form of book. It's very popular book, how, how did I name it?\nJamael Tanvir: Hisnul Muslim, exactly. Hisnul Muslim. So it has a huge list of duas uh, from Rasulullah and also from Quran. So uh, when I do this Tawaf or Sai, I actually continue reading dua from this. So I can only imagine if uh, this app also has uh, some listing of these duas, popular duas, that would definitely help. And obviously uh, if a user can, you know, um, choose some duas from them, their, I mean, his favorite duas, for example, the duas that are very relevant to his life, and make them favorite, and then later he can just open those favorite duas and just uh, read them, that would definitely help a lot.\nMuhammad: I see.\nMuhammad: Okay. Um, now the coming to the next point is, and that's the last section we're going to cover: how impactful our Umrah is. So to make our Umrah really spiritually transformative and um, to have like a long-lasting effect uh, after completing Umrah, so that when we go into a regular life, we don't become the same person as we were before Umrah, rather we transform into a better version of our past selves. How do you think an app like this can help?\nJamael Tanvir: Uh, okay. It's a difficult question. Um, so I think uh, I think what gives me better clarity about these things are um, the things or or the uh, or the workshops or the meetings that uh, I have or I had before going to Makkah. So the preparation actually helps uh, or helped me a lot to reflect on those things. I mean, the actual action uh, is something that is uh, an aftermath of the preparation in my opinion.\nJamael Tanvir: So uh, to, I mean, understand or to uh, feel the importance of these actions, you really need to learn what you are going to do. So from that point of view, if uh, this app can provide all these contents that helps the user to understand that you are going to perform these things and what what are the, you know, benefits, what are the significance of this, what are the significance of these things, uh, uh, then the user will be able to understand that, yes, I'm going to do these actions, I, I'm going to perform Umrah, I'm going to uh, go for Hajj and perform these actions. Then he will feel within himself that, yes, now I'm doing something that is a very, very important part of my life that automatically helps the Hajis to reflect upon it. But if someone just goes there directly without any preparation or anything, without understanding what he's going to do, I, I, I would think that it will not really help him understand or reflect uh, in his life, help him reflect in his life.\nJamael Tanvir: So uh, so as I, as I, as I was saying, uh, from that point of view, if the app can give the user a proper preparation, that should automatically help the user to, you know, reflect and ponder upon those things. And also, um, for example, when we go for Hajj with the travel agency, uh, usually they try to uh, arrange some um, uh, halaqah with uh, with scholars, that also helps a lot uh, to reflect on these things. Uh, so maybe uh, the app also can contain some uh, video contents from some renowned scholars regarding these topics, maybe that can also help the user to, you know, uh, watch and reflect on those things.\nMuhammad: I see. So just to summarize, if I say like when you are doing training and when you are doing the Umrah itself, you are making certain duas, that time you have a very like high spiritual state. And then if we can enable uh, the journaling within the app, so you write down your thoughts, your raw points, your raw ideas, and using LLM, we can create like a three-month plan or some uh, pledge you can follow for the rest of your life. Uh, this can include uh, like praying regularly in masjid, reading Quran uh, regularly or being like a better person. And after even you perform the Umrah, the app uh, reminds you to do certain things. And I think that would be beneficial for you, right?\nJamael Tanvir: Yes, absolutely. I mean, um, it's a good point that you made about uh, you know, writing a journal or, you know, uh, using AI LLM to communicate your intention uh, so that you get some feedback. So these things actually help since we have this technology uh, at hand. Obviously, you can, we can leverage these things and try to utilize and find a good solution from, from these things. So I, I think it's a good point that you made, and if it's possible to incorporate these things into the app, uh, it will definitely, definitely help.\nMuhammad: Okay.\nMuhammad: I think uh, that's all the questions I have. So I'd like to finish by asking you to ask uh, like your suggestion, your commitment, and like the monetary challenge of the monetary system of the app. So if we make an app like that, and next time you perform Umrah, if we like you to buy this app, I believe, would you be comfortable? And if you are, then how much do you think would be a fair amount of money to charge for such an app um, as a one-time purchase?\nJamael Tanvir: So um, yeah, I mean, I was thinking uh, there, there could be two options. One is uh, this uh, one-time purchase, and another one is a subscription-based model. Um, maybe, maybe in this case, uh, one-time purchase is uh, more suitable because uh, we do not perform Umrah every month or every year, maybe uh, or every two, three months, usually it's not the case. So subscription-based model may not be suitable. Uh, uh, so in case of one-time purchase, I would think, um, I don't know actually, um, so it depends on what the app can provide. So if,\nMuhammad: Everything we discussed like.\nJamael Tanvir: Yeah, I mean, if, if the app can provide everything that we discussed, maybe, maybe uh, I don't know, something between um, 20 to $30 in terms of, I'm just saying in terms of dollars, maybe $20 to $30 should be, should be fine, good enough, I think. So if I, instead of offering one-time payment, if it's uh, give you like a yearly subscription, so you pay for and the content will remain there for a year, so in that case, uh, how much do you think might be good? Um, okay, in case of this kind of subscription model, um, uh, I would think um, I would say $10.\nJamael Tanvir: I mean, I'm, it's uh, kind of difficult to calculate at this point. Maybe, maybe later I can give you better insight about this uh, because it involves a lot of, lot of, lot of uh, factors uh, which uh, may not be possible for me to think at this point, but uh, definitely I will try to share more information, more insight later.\nMuhammad: Okay, makes sense. Makes sense.\nMuhammad: So, Insha'Allah, if it is okay, we will communicate with you uh, down the line regarding this and ask your suggestion to be a better tester with us, right?\nJamael Tanvir: Sure, Insha'Allah, I'll be happy to comment, I mean, discuss about these things.\nMuhammad: Okay, okay. Thank you, Jamael Bhai, uh, for your time. I think this has been really wonderful talking with you and getting so many beneficial insights uh, from you, um, and thank you very much uh, for it. Uh, thank you very much to you as well. It was nice talking to you and I uh, I hope and I make dua to Allah that uh, you uh, you know, whatever we discussed, you can actually find uh, you know, uh, implement those things in the app and it will be, Insha'Allah, very, very beneficial to the users."

    "english_transcript": "[Segment 1] Muhammad: Hi John. Hello. G. Okay. Alhamdulillah. Studio, for sure. Multiple monthly public for inviting me. I think so. Something like this.\nMuhammad: Okay, you can start by introducing yourself for inviting me for this noble cause. May Allah bless your intention, brother.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: My name is [best guess: Mahmud Iqbal Halim]. Alhamdulillah, I was able to complete the holy journey of Hajj this year, 2025, which was like 1446 Hijri. And I joined the journey from Bangladesh even though I'm staying in Canada, and for my experience, I try my best to help give the best question answer possible.\n[Segment 2] Muhammad: Okay. Um, so by, um, as you live in Canada, um, and you have dual Bangladesh and Canadian nationality, you have the option to do from either country. So, what made you choose your Hajj to do from Bangladesh instead of Canada?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: So, I think there are perspectives from different ways I can explain. Initially, I was not able to even think about it because I have little kids to take care of, like one is five, another was like three and a half. So, the main challenge was for me to think about their custody while we were away. Like, we went, me and my wife, along with my mom joined us. So, we were thinking to bring some of the relatives here, but ideally, we couldn't find anyone. So, our only option was to keep the kids at some relatives' place so that we have no tension about them. And also, budget-wise, I think it's pretty expensive even here in from Canada, even though you can save a lot of time if you fly from Canada way back to Saudi to Canada again. But alhamdulillah, when I came to know it's possible to use my Bangladeshi passport, and everything was like giving me a positive vibe that I can do it from Bangladesh, even though there will be an added journey. But everything was smooth, alhamdulillah. And yes, that's it. Budget and custody of my children when I'll be performing the Hajj was my consideration to going from Bangladesh.\nMuhammad: Okay, inshallah. Um, let's move to the next segment, which is preparation, right? So, you came right after Hajj to Bangladesh. So, I believe many of the preparations you took were through online class and watching the recording of the meeting. So, do you feel it was sufficient for you to understand what you need to do spiritually and logistically just by watching the training online and watching recorded videos?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, of course. I would say that was a great help to prepare myself, not only logistically, but also, as you said, from a spiritual perspective. I tried to follow as much as I could the lecture sessions or like the webinar shared by the agency. By the way, the agency we went with was like Shepard Umrah Service, I believe their full name. They're pretty professional and very cooperative, I would say. And they actually offered all the sessions way back, our primary registration, and that helped us to, you know, build up the momentum regarding the preparation from all around the aspects, like being it logistic, what do we need to do, including every single detail, like any minor thing, how to prepare even for your physical fitness and all the paperworks if you are coming for short terms, including medical tests and stuff like that. And also how to prepare and the documents, especially because you are traveling from another country, right? So the sessions were conducted by the agency guides as well as their sheikhs or scholars who will help us to shape our training period for this holy journey. And alhamdulillah, it was super helpful to get the real feel how it's going to look like in real time.\n[Segment 3] Muhammad: I see. Now, the second thing is regarding this training, which I believe was really helpful for you. Do you have to take any additional training from YouTube videos or from other sources, or that was pretty sufficient?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: In some cases, I had my own questions because the sessions and webinars were mostly live, but I couldn't join the live one because of the time difference, you know? Like there is 10-11 hours difference between the training happening live and the time we live here in North America. So when I had some questions, I used to ask other people who joined us before me, like last year or so, with the same agency, or even they had the experience beforehand. I used to go to them, discuss, and also watch for sessions or lectures on a specific topic on YouTube. So those were helpful, but I felt like if I wasn't present in person, maybe I could have a better understanding or even, I mean, that could have been better in some ways, like, you know, team building. We went and we shared, like, a lot of people, like in my room, I was sharing the room with like four other people, the brothers came along all across the world. But I felt like with the management team, I could have made a good relationship. But even though that was not that impactful, like knowing them and seeing them for the first time when I was in Mecca. But, yep, I mean, pretty much it was quite okay for me.\n[Segment 4] Muhammad: Okay. So, for example, next time if you go to Hajj or Umrah, though you did it once, if there is an app that has some video lectures and very practical training regarding how to perform Hajj and Umrah, just as a refresher, would you think it would be valuable for you?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: I would say definitely it will add value, not only for the rituals but also a lot of stuff, I think they help you to make your preparation right. And I found that when you have preparation, especially for this holy journey, and it's like, I think this is the biggest crowd I have ever joined in any particular event. So it really helped a lot because I tried to find and follow some of the apps that were available at that time, like Nusuk, but I believe that was not customized or just for these events like Umrah. And all of the apps that I went through or like the guidelines, I think something was missing. And any interactive app should, I think, be more helpful for people like me going for the first time or even the second time. Of course, I gathered a lot of experience for the first time. But again, if I could do like a mock test in an interactive app, that could have a better impact. But I was doing it in real because a lot of things, as you plan, but it's a huge gathering and that's like unbelievable rush. So having an app definitely would keep you in line, right? Like which ritual comes after what and what you need to do, especially making duas and doing the rituals. For example, like Umrah, when you enter the mosque, and even before that, when you are wearing your Ihram and you are not making the Nia since you are coming from a different zone, not in Saudi, right? So, yeah, if it's like on the app step by step, it gives the whole picture in front of you and you know what was missing and what is coming through and what dua or prayer you have to make, right? And step by step, it's really helpful to have an interactive app, not only just with the rituals, but also a lot of preparation materials, I mean, item-wise or action-wise, that would really help.\n[Segment 5] Muhammad: I see. Have you used an app called Duolingo?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: I actually didn't have Duolingo. I used like Google Translate, to be honest, that was a lifesaver.\nMuhammad: No, no, I'm just asking, do you know how this quiz-based Duolingo app works?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Oh yeah, Duolingo. Yeah, I'm quite familiar with that.\nMuhammad: So, do you think something like that, but for Hajj and Umrah? So the idea would be, before, so there's a learning module. So you can learn about in detail what is Hajj, Umrah, all the rituals, and then you can test your knowledge. And the knowledge would be, it will give you a scenario and it will ask which dua you would like to make and you have to find the dua. Then the second option would be to...\n[Segment 6] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I think this is a great idea because, yeah, I mean, often I saw people, they were hesitant to ask questions to the fellow Hajji or even the scholar in that group or even the agency people. Sometimes they were not available. So yeah, that would be really good. But hey, again, there are scenarios that you never expect, right? But as long as you can cover the most common scenarios, yeah, I think that's a great idea.\nMuhammad: Yeah, and then you can do like a quiz-based learning and first, like, maintaining serial, there can be small puzzles and games. So, for example, when you go to Hajj, there will be a scenario like, \"Okay, which comes first, Mina, Arafat?\" And then you have to arrange them together like a small puzzle. So, this way, you would learn this thing in an interactive way. So I'm thinking of doing this. Also, if you remember, during the times, the Qatine app that we are working on, that was beta, I think I gave you access. Were you able to install that?\n[Segment 7] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yes, I was able to install that, but I believe there was some sort of troubleshooting you have been doing, right?\nMuhammad: Yes. So, were you able to use it? At that time, it was not usable for you?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: I think some of the features were usable, not all of them. I understand that was not fully released or there was like a beta version, right? (Yeah, yeah)\nMuhammad: At that time, it only had the Umrah module. So, if you were able to use that, would you like to share some feedback regarding that?\n[Segment 8] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, of course. So, when I started my journey from home, I was not quite sure when to wear the Ihram, for example. Should I wear it from my home or where should I make the Nia? And there was a little bit of confusion. As I told you, it's a rush and logistically, if you are taking too much on your shoulder, you have to figure out the other stuff, even though you are being joined by a couple of other people or friends or known faces, it comes at the end, how you are doing yourself. So I think at that time, if I had such kind of app, so that I can go to, I know what exactly I need to do, like what dua I need to make, or what time I need to make my Nia, or if there are any like Noah prayer, or what I can do or what I cannot do during my [inaudible - possibly Umrah/Hajj rituals]. So that was quite, I thought, that would be definitely helpful for that. And also when I went to the Haram...\n[Segment 9] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...for the Tawaf, for the Sai, I was asking people what to do. And also, I was, you know, carrying too many notebooks with dua list, and some are recommended and some are mandatory, right? So an app like this, because we all carry phones, right, should make things easy.\nMuhammad: So thank you for the feedback. Unfortunately, we just made the app available right after you performed Umrah. But next time you go to Umrah, you can definitely try it out because right now it is on full release in the market, and by that time, we can make it even better. Moving forward to the next question, how overwhelming it was when you moved to Makkah? Like, you have to have a long travel, like there was tiredness of traveling, visiting your luggage, getting settled in the hotel and doing Umrah right away. How difficult was it?\n[Segment 10] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Honestly speaking, logistically, I didn't feel anything that difficult because, as I told you, part of our preparation was having patience all the time. Because what I came to know, the authority over there in Saudi, they're changing, they're ever variable and ever-changing. So, this time of the year, like in Hajj, it was super strict security-wise, and a lot of checks and restrictions came down to limit the number of unregistered Hajis. So, I didn't feel quite overwhelming because I was quite ready for it. Anything unexpected can happen. It actually started happening right away from the Hajj camp when we started our journey formally, before flying the plane. And also, when we boarded in Jeddah, the security or these after-procedures were really tiring. But, yeah, alhamdulillah, the preparation, the mental preparation was the key, you know. Sometimes you have nothing to do, you have to follow the rules, and the rules are ever-changing. That's the mindset I went with, and that helped me a lot. And I think if people have the information beforehand, they could have been, you know, more patient in some cases.\nMuhammad: I think one thing you particularly did, if I remember, like we had a conversation and I gave an idea to you that to buy a SIM card from Bangladesh which has roaming capability, but you chose not to do so. So, do you think it was the right decision to buy the SIM card directly from there, or [inaudible]?\n[Segment 11] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, again, it depends. It's a huge crowd, right, in just a couple of days, four to five days. But I saw people were having trouble with their roaming SIM in some cases, not all of the cases, because the Saudi SIM has a problem like in WhatsApp, you cannot make a call, you can just text. And for some people, obviously for senior people, texting is not a good solution. Not always. Like for my mom, she's not quite good at texting over the smartphone. So we saw people had a lot of issues. So what we did, we took a package for, I think, a week from Bangladesh SIM roaming. Then after that, we actually bought a package in Saudi SIM that was quite, I would say, a good decision in terms of communication. Because at the time of Mina or Arafat, you know, a lot of people are using the same area, so if you have the local SIM, that will give you an edge in terms of communication. And trust me, it gives you a lot less headache when you are lost in the Haram Sharif or any place in Arafat or Mina, to use a map. And I found it is working better. But what I did, I did download a manual offline map, I would say. But in terms of communication, I found it better to buy a SIM from Saudi, even though some people might find it expensive, but that gives you a lot of headache away.\n[Segment 12] Muhammad: Out of headache, you can communicate with your family if you're going in a group. I see. So I think what you're saying is it's a good idea to buy a SIM card, but...\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Eventually you have to buy, if, if you, I mean, depending on your package. Initially, it's tough to find a spot where to buy because you don't know when you get the hotel room. And without the hotel room, it's tough to, you know, settle yourself and go for buying a SIM card. Because I think it took us like two days to figure out where to buy the SIM card, even though there are a lot of stalls. But I didn't take the chance. I did take the roaming for like seven days, and meanwhile, I managed to buy the Saudi SIM.\n[Segment 13] Muhammad: Okay, so I think it's a good idea to get like a roaming SIM initially and then buy like...\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: But not for the whole journey.\nMuhammad: Yeah, makes sense, makes sense. Um, so you're talking about maps and location. How important was, uh, one thing is like seeing the map where you are. I think that aspect is covered by Google Map. But how important was location sharing with your other, other like the agency and other people there doing Hajj with you, and how easy it was for you?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, for me, it was something different because I took my mom with me. And my wife was actually looking after her because I cannot go all the places. There is a separation for men and women, of course, understand, except for some of the rituals. So I also use like Apple, but location sharing was the key when you were moving with your agency or the guides, right? And when you have the map, you know, even if you are lost, you can find somewhere, like sharing the address, you know, it's easier to find, right? And even though like the same picture, but with the Google Map, I think it's easier. So, I was thinking, if something, I know I saw a lot of images even in terms of where to move and how the crowd is moving during those days. So, an interactive map, like to give an idea, would have added some value using not only the location sharing because sometimes even if you share the location, it's hard to find. But yeah, it's overall good, but I think if people have a more interactive map, like a Duolingo, they can do their own research, like when to move and how to move from one place to another. That would give them a better idea before going there because a lot of people, that's their first time, like I was doing my first time in Mecca and Medina.\n[Segment 14] Muhammad: Okay. So basically, you said like in an app that has a Google Map traffic kind of feature, but traffic instead of traffic, it was more like movement, like where the roads, how people are moving, how things are happening. If you have those information and also, it can, you can use location...\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: What I mean, logistically, we were staying in Azizia, which is not close to the Haram Sharif, right, in Mecca. So what I'm trying to say here, like to give a little bit idea, because logistically, I found it challenging because a lot of roads were closed, right? You know, you also been there for a couple of times, like the road closure and what to do in terms of road closure when you were using the taxi service. When it's not available, you can go for alternative bus service because bus service initially it was quite, I would say, easier compared to the taxi one, even though the taxi is, you know, fast. But for, how can I say, like the Hajj days, like two or three days before the Hajj began, it was too much crowd. And we had a lot of issues with road closure while coming and going back and forth from Haram Sharif to Azizia. So what I'm trying to say, if we knew some information how to manage those interactively with some map...\n[Segment 15] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...that would have been better for us because I remember when we went for the first Juma in Haram Sharif, our taxi left us almost 2 km away, and we just followed the crowd to reach there. But we didn't expect it because when we finished the prayer, the group were scattered, and I had a hard time to find my wife. My mom stayed back at the hotel because we thought during the daytime, it was not a good decision to take her in these hot summer days, right? So logistically, that's a preparation. I think if we find a better idea with the interactive map or something informative, that would be great tips, like that might be a section for transportation or logistics.\n[Segment 16] Muhammad: So, what do you think? How can we solve it?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: A good idea can come from a great question. So, I mean, I didn't know about the bus service because taxi service from time to time, it might get tough. But I think a lot of people, if they know before and how to use the bus service and how to follow the map, that would have made life easier because initially we were dependent fully on taxi, and sometimes taxi was not available. Even though it was available, it was super expensive. The bus service was super easy, but getting to that, it's not easy. So, what I'm trying to say, if you put some contents about the traffic movement during this time, during the rush time, people would have a better idea, right? So they can better prepare themselves. Okay, if this situation arises, what I can do or how can I face this difficulty? For people who are living far away from the Haram during this Hajj or after Hajj, I think it is better for them to use the bus service because it goes as much as close to the Haram Sharif, saves a lot of hassle finding a taxi and whatsoever. I mean, it's just an idea, like if we can do something or find something in any resource to navigate those.\n[Segment 17] Muhammad: Okay. So, I'll share what we are planning to do in this, uh, this course. What we are planning to do, um, is, uh, we are going to use similar service like Google Maps. So, ideally, when people use our service, we ask them to share their location data. So, this is going to act as a GPS, and this is going to be shared with other Hajis, right? So, for example, if people can see like in some area if people are moving slowly, that means it's walking. If there are people moving slowly and some people are moving fast, that means there is a car going on. Then, in terms of bus service, people can tweet and share, like similar to Twitter, people can or Waze people can share information. So, we are focusing on...\n[Segment 18] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, like in Google Maps we see, right, when you are driving, it gives you a lot, like the road exposure ahead, or there is a, like...\nMuhammad: Exactly, that's something we're planning to do. And also, we are trying to guide the people using content. So, for example, we are telling, if somebody is in Haram and that person is looking for a taxi, we are either telling like, \"Okay, you can go to Ajyad corner,\" or \"You can go to Gaza corner,\" or \"You can go to Haram tunnel.\"\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Yes. So that, that was what I'm trying to mention, thank you for, like, you know, shaping it formally. Because we were entering the Haram from different doors, and we didn't know which door we can come out because they are closer, right? So if you put a little bit of idea, like, okay, if you are getting out of gate number 79, this is the closest you can get a bus, or this is the closest you can go to a taxi, right? And if you just give some sort of like picture, the route where to get the taxi or the buses from, because we didn't know before for our mandatory Tawaf that there is a bus stand which actually really works like a shuttle to put you, like the people, in a space where more buses or taxis are available. Because during the prayer time, all the roads, most of the roads, are closed, right? So that shuttle service, we didn't know. So stuff like that, like if you are like the more used places, like as you said, like Ajyad Road or the Khalil Road or Jin? Was it Jin Masjid, I'm not sure.\n[Segment 19] Muhammad: Yes, yes. Like there's another place, like the Palestine Road.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, in Palestine, Palestine.\nMuhammad: Yeah.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: So there are like a bus stop. We didn't know. We came to realize after we explored and actually we got lost and we had to explore. So stuff like that, like, okay, if you are in this point, this is the closest road to get through, or if you are stuck, you're not finding a taxi, what might be the alternate solution? Because what I found most irritating, it actually killed a lot of time in commuting if I don't know the place. And when I was with the guides, they know how to get out of here, right? Because even if you're with your guide, lots of time you are getting lost, or might be like your path is different. For example, the guide is taking you just for the Tawaf, and they are not allowing you to make any prayer or stay for the prayer. But you decided to stay back and now you're alone. And when you are coming back to your hotel, you are like killing more than two or three hours for commuting, just for a 20-minute drive. So that's a frustrating part I noticed, and due to these information missing, I was not happy.\n[Segment 20] Muhammad: Yeah, I actually share my story as well. I was a guide, I was myself a guide in 2024 Hajj, and I, I held Hajj, like I took some Hajis for doing the Tawaf and then planned to come home, and I stayed behind. And then I kind of got on a bus. I was hoping it would go, and then I could not. The bus dropped me somewhere. I had to walk a long stretch of road in hot summer, and I got very dehydrated, and I actually became sick. So even guides, because the road closure and things happen so random, they might not even know. So one challenge to what we're planning to do, implementing, is like incentivizing people. So of course, inshallah, people would like to share this information because it would be a great Ajr, because they are helping themselves and they're helping others as well, and that will make that much easier. Another thing we are planning to do is make this a mutual thing. So, for example, we are giving them live information, and you only get live information when you share your location data. So that means you are getting location data from others, and in return, you are giving your location data back. If you don't share your location, you will not get any insight. Do you think that would be acceptable by...?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: I mean, sharing location, I don't think, if people are feeling a different way to share their location, some people might have reservations about that. And I think it should be, since it's a kind of doing beneficial act for others, like a Sadaqa, it should be more easier because some people I saw, they were asking for me, \"Hey, brother, please stay with me because I'm not good with maps. So, I'll follow you. I'll hold your hands.\" I said, \"I'm sorry because I have to take care of my mom. I cannot tell or I cannot guarantee you that I can be always with you. It's better to set up the map sharing.\" But they were not convinced, and they were sad when I told them I cannot be with them forever, because it was my experience, I even lost my wife and my mom sometimes in the crowd, right? So, I mean, I think we should look for an easy one. Even people are not contributing, they can make comments, stuff like that. Because I found a lot of senior people, they are not able to use the map properly. So in the app, if you put like a note section, okay, \"I cannot share my, like, both ways, like you can share your location or not,\" but you can put comments, right? Like, \"This is happening in this area, so don't come this way, this road is closed,\" or stuff like that.\n[Segment 21] Muhammad: I see. I see. Okay, makes sense. So it can be like a crowd-sourced stream where people can see what's going on. Um, so that, these are really good insights. Uh, so that covers mostly like the logistical challenges, movement during the Hajj, and you also shared regarding your rituals, you had lots of books. So an app like that would help. You particularly mentioned regarding your mother. I think she doesn't able to have a, um, like a cell phone, but one suggestion I gave you was to take an AirTag. So, do you think giving her an AirTag, she was able to carry and you were able to track her location?\n[Segment 22] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, that's exactly what I did. If you remember, we were talking about this because we took the wheelchair from Bangladesh, and also, we are not always relying on the wheelchair. So what I did, we shared AirTags in between us so that each of us can track and follow where our locations are. So that actually helped during our last days when we were doing the farewell Tawaf, we actually lost each other, and the AirTag helped us a lot because I was calling them, they said we are in this side, I was not finding them because the location was not precise in Google. And even the AirTag, it's more approximate, and it helped a lot to track where each of us were. So it helped us a lot, the AirTagging.\n[Segment 23] Muhammad: Nice. Nice. Okay. Now, in terms of, uh, like doing traveling around Makkah and Medina itself and doing shopping, seeing the, like, more, uh, like spots. So I know, like, Makkah days were very hectic for you because you went for a short trip. And, um, were you able to visit Ta'if?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: No. Unfortunately, no, this time. Because when we decided to go to Ta'if, in the very beginning, we were busy with our, like, Umrah and other stuff, settling ourselves down there. And when we decided to go there, we were informed there might be road closure, so it might go into vain if we take any attempt. So we actually didn't choose to go to Ta'if this time because, you know, that was a short trip for us. We actually went there just four or five days before the Hajj began. So we were more concentrating on going into Haram or making as much as we could Ibadah in the Haram, making or spending our times mostly in the Haram area. But again, we tried to explore a little bit here, like we went to, uh, what is called, like the Hira Cave.\n[Segment 24] Muhammad: Yeah, right. Jabal ar-Rahmah? Is it Jabal ar-Rahmah? Jabal al-Nour.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Jabal [best guess: al-Nour].\nMuhammad: Yes.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Jabal [best guess: al-Nour].\nMuhammad: Yes.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah. So we couldn't explore Jabal al-Nour. That's another popular spot. But we had an arrangement from our agency, but that was very quick. Just the day before we were moving to Medina, they put everything together. I think everything was in a rush and we avoided that because at that time we stayed in Mina, we had to do our stoning. Same day we had to do our farewell Tawaf, and then same day they arranged for the little tour in the nearby places in Mecca. So we avoided that. So we tried to do some Ziyarah just before the Hajj, and I think we just visited two or three, no, max, I just only one, the Hira one, Jabal.\n[Segment 25] Muhammad: And how was the Medina experience, especially with shopping, visiting various gardens?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Shopping-wise, like the place we used to live in, like in Alia, there is a...\nMuhammad: No, I mean in Medina market.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You mentioned both of this, like... I mean, to be honest, logistically, it was quite easier to do shopping from Mecca because it was just in front of your hotel, right? And there's a huge market, Souq Salam. But we were advised by the guides and other stuff helping us in the hotel. They said it's better to do shopping in Medina. In Medina, like that, yeah, it's cheaper. You have variety, and you have a lot of bargaining power.\n[Segment 26] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: But what happened in Medina, we were more, you know, busy with staying more in the Masjid an-Nabawi. But the most challenging thing was to buy quality dates from Medina. And even though we had a Ziyarah in Medina, we went to, uh, [best guess: Umman], like there was a date farm, I believe. We couldn't buy it from there because our guide told us it's not wise to buy from the farms; it's better to buy from the market. And we explored a lot, and I was asking people where to buy and which item to buy from which market because there are a lot of markets. They're good for items like dates or stuff like that or fruits or whatever, and some are good for, you know, for dresses for both men and women. And there are some special shops or markets for buying costly items. And by the time I figured out, our days in Medina were over, and I had to rush and do some shopping very quickly. So I think it's a good idea if you can add some points like doing shopping, like the most popular spot people can go, like item-wise. Like some people, they're looking for cheap items. I saw a lot of...\n[Segment 27] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...shops there, like two Riyals, three Riyals. They're posting outside and most of them are on the Quba Road. It was not like, you have to have a lot of time for shopping, right? And the timing is quite short because during the daytime, if you go out, it's too hot. You have to take it in, and you have to fight with the humidity. It's very low, but the heat is too much. So the only time we got out was after Isha prayer, or sometimes in between Maghrib and Asr. But I think if you put some information in the app that would be easy for people to navigate through, like which market area is good for what item or what they need to. Because I didn't know there was a wholesale market, actually, that was a good thing because I could buy a lot of stuff and save a lot of time, right? But if you're looking for like a customized item, say for example, I was actually looking for a good quality prayer mat, and I saw a lot of Chinese products, and I was confused. And finally, I figured out all of the sources are the same, but you have to know the right place because some places, they're really good. They don't give you the hype, \"Okay, this is the best quality.\" So you have to spend what you get for, right? And some stores, like, they were classy, especially for, I was looking for, like, there was a brother who was my roommate, he said which brand to look for if you're looking for good quality. So that helped me a lot. But if you put it in your app, I think that will help people more so that they have more idea, like the price range, the quality, and stuff like that.\n[Segment 28] Muhammad: Okay. So, I think places to, so if we do like places to go for food, what are some of the good things to try?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: I didn't explore the food side at all, except like I went for like, uh... No, no, and that was missed completely. I actually had a lot of juice. So, there are a lot of juice bars and stuff like that. And I also had some Bangladeshi flavor tea from one of the Bangladeshi stores in Medina. That was good. And I found out people were enjoying Kalabuna with a lot of various items. So that was mouth-watering. But that was bad timing for me because I just finished my lunch and joined there...\n[Segment 29] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...for just a cup of tea.\nMuhammad: Okay. So, yeah, that's a good idea because if people want to explore the cuisine, the local cuisine, I think that's a good idea. And also, I know a lot of people, they want to buy gold. And I heard something that encouraged me a lot because some of them are saying there was a new restriction in Bangladesh. And I'm not a big fan of gold, so I didn't have too much. But if you put some information regarding buying golds, where to buy from, like these are all additional, right, appendix of the core items that are helpful, like that saves people time. And I think when you can save time, you can put more effort and more time into Ibadah, where you are actually there for.\n[Segment 30] Muhammad: And I think people will pay money for that, right, if it, if it saves people, right? You can make a premium version, \"Okay, you have to pay for this secret information if you want to save your time and money.\"\nMuhammad: Okay, so if I want totally your perspective and be honest with me, what do you think should be free for everyone and what can be in the premium version?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: It's tough to say.\nMuhammad: I see.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: If I were you, I would put everything for free. But I would definitely see if I'm spending any money for giving any service, obviously, I could charge people for that.\n[Segment 31] Muhammad: So, I think if all the things we discussed, like ritual guidance, like Ibadah guidance, logistical guidance, maybe like shopping and then shopping, like sightseeing guidance, like all of them I put and say I charge $15 for one time in a trip. Do you think you would pay for that $15 or that would be...?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: $15 is too much.\n[Segment 32] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: People do a lot of Google nowadays, you know, and YouTube YouTubers are there with videos. But I think if you want to make some money out of it, it's better to give them some real value. Like if you can arrange them, or if you give them exact information. For example, we know we can take a shared drive from Masjid an-Nabawi to Quba, but we were scammed by drivers, like the language was the main barrier, right? So I think you can include Google Translate into the app so that people know where you can bargain or where you cannot. Because we also used like 30 Riyals to come back from Quba to Masjid an-Nabawi, and we also spent like two Riyals each person for making the same ride, right? So, I mean, the information is money, and it saves a lot of time. But it's early to say for what purpose you can charge people. For example, if you have an arrangement with an agency who can give you like the tour plan, for example, if they want to explore places around Medina which has historical significance, of course, related to the Seerah and stuff like that, other interesting places, and you have like agency communication, so that way they can save money or get discounts, right? It's mutual, like you see Uber gives you some offers, say buy one get one free, so it's absolutely not free, they're making some money out of it, right? The restaurant, they're not losing any money. They're also making money. So that way, that's something you can explore into. But I'm not sure how the model will look like. But just for the regular information, just helping out people, I think that's a good one. But for premium, I think you have to initially see how it goes and then you can classify what is actually worth paying for.\n[Segment 33] Muhammad: Okay. So, if I ask you, what do you think would be a fair price? If I just from your perspective, how much would you be willing to pay for a service like that? It's completely fine if you think, \"I don't know, you don't want to pay a dime,\" that's fine, you can share it.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Sorry, I didn't get your question.\n[Segment 34] Muhammad: So I'm asking from your perspective, how much you would be willing to pay for an app like this, and please be honest. If you feel like you don't want to pay a dime for it, that is fine, you can share that as well, but give me an honest answer, how much you'd be willing to pay.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: I think if I find it, whatever we discussed here, if everything is there, and it's super interactive and easy to use, I have no issues spending minimum $5 to $10.\nMuhammad: I see. Now,\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: But we have to defer the prices for people across the board because some people, they don't want to use the app for a price.\n[Segment 35] Muhammad: I see. I see. Makes sense. So, for regional... So for me, like $5, maybe okay. It's okay, $5. But for people living coming from other areas, it might be like $500, right? It might sound, \"Okay, it's too much.\" So, \"What I'm actually getting for this $500?\" So you have to make it worthy. They said, \"No, I paid $500 and it was worth it.\" So till preparation to the end, if you cover most of the things and make it interactive, like the way you added the Duolingo, like the quiz or interactive preparation, I think those are good points.\n[Segment 36] Muhammad: Right, okay, that makes sense. Um, I want to ask you another thing regarding translation and communication. Many people complain about that. So I'll share you two models, you will get which model you like most, right? In one model, it's Google Translate. So you speak and the other person speaks, and what they're speaking is going to be translated to you in English. On the other hand, instead of you directly speaking to them, you talk with an AI that what you want to do, and then what AI will do, AI will speak with a person fluently because AI can do communication right now, and AI will, AI will get the information from that person and AI will just show like a live caption what it is speaking. Is there something different than the Google Translate?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Yes, the difference is that in here Google is just translating, but Google is not conversing. You are doing the conversation. But on the other hand, it's not you doing the conversation. You are telling AI to grab you a taxi within, say, example, 10 Riyals, right? And what AI will do, AI will talk with the real person and AI will...\nMuhammad: It will continue the conversation.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: Yes, it will do the conversation.\nMuhammad: Wow. In Arabic. Do you think that will make sense for people?\n[Segment 37] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, that looks nice and that looks good.\nMuhammad: I see, okay, okay. I think, um, that's all the questions I have. Regarding Hajj, I want to end it by asking you two questions. One is after Hajj life. So, for example, if Hajj is more like a community with a group of people. So if you, like, meet people in the Hajj and all of you and your Hajj buddies, they started using the app. Do you think it would be useful for you to have this app for free even after you come from Hajj? So you can see like Hajj memories popped up, you can communicate with them. Um...\n[Segment 38] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, I think you can. After Hajj experience or after Hajj, like, follow-up is pretty important. Rather than whatever memory I had, just to, you know, ponder upon the learning that I'm supposed to be on. That's the change that I should be looking continuously for, right? So I was thinking, if there is any way I can follow up, and not only interact with other people or ponder on the memories, but also some activities just to keep myself focused, what I learned from Hajj and how I'm acting upon it. Like, I heard a lot of scholars saying, if you keep doing good work or if you keep doing Sadaqa, stuff like that, so that you are somehow, you know, holding the rope. I'm not sure if I can, yeah.\n[Segment 39] Muhammad: And regarding your next step, inshallah, Allah accept your Hajj as my Hajj, and Allah again take you to Makkah and Medina to do Umrah. So if you want to do Umrah, are you planning to go with an agency or are you planning to do it by yourself based on your experience? And come again. So what I said is, if you plan to do Umrah within a few years, do you plan to do Umrah through an agency or do you plan to do Umrah by yourself?\n[Segment 40] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Uh, it depends, I don't know. But logistically, I think I'm more informed now to perform my Umrah, and obviously, it will make my journey straightforward, everything under my control. But again, if I choose to go with an agency, I came to know some people, they are doing this journey not only just as rituals, just to have a theme or stuff like that while doing these rituals. Because ritual-wise, it's straightforward, right? Whatever you do, like Umrah or Hajj. But if you don't have the mindset of why you are doing it, of course, it's an Ibadah, like it's one of the pillars, the Hajj. But if you don't see the aftermath, the results in yourself, the changes in your lifestyle or in your thinking, I think that's the biggest gap he will carry forward, right? So I will see how it goes. But to me, it's more challenging to keep the spirit up, being connected spiritually from the beginning to end, and the end is not the end, the end is just another beginning, right? So you have to be like, I mean, I think I need to be more watchful what I'm doing after doing an Umrah Hajj, if there is changing the level of my sincerity in my this world and preparation for the next world.\nMuhammad: I see. So, inshallah, if you plan to do Umrah again, and if this app comes in and helps you as a spiritual guidance and gives you a theme, for example, you can choose a theme, like you can take a 15-day Umrah tour, and your theme can be like learning about, say, for example, or if you're doing Ramadan, you want to learn about Tafsir, and within this day, it can give you some lessons, um, it can arrange, it can tell you which part to go, which, um...\n[Segment 41] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: Yeah, I mean, which area I can more focus on, right? Like if I go for Ramadan Umrah, yeah. Or... Yeah.\nMuhammad: And you can buy air ticket, everything from the app. I think that would be helpful, right?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: I think that's a more extensive idea, right? To add on these like shopping or regarding the logistics information. But the whole idea, I would say, again, just to keep your focus on what is the main purpose, right? Because I was more worried about the logistical part. But after being this year, alhamdulillah, may Allah give them best of the reward to the agency. They made our life easy logistically. Somehow it will be managed, that's my understanding, if you have the proper mental preparation, \"Okay, lots of challenges are coming on the way.\" But the most important thing to me is to keep connected and to revive your spirituality.\n[Segment 42] Muhammad: Okay, I want to ask you one thing. We can discuss about lots of things like ritual, then logistics, then after Hajj program, um, then even like booking hotel and air ticket. Do you think if having all of them in one Hajj super app is a good idea, or instead of doing that, is it better to have separate apps, like if you think like Facebook...?\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: What I think, you can have one simple app, but you can have different sections, and those sections could, in itself, be super-duper equipped, right? So you never know, like for people I know, they're going for Hajj or Umrah every year...\n[Segment 43] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: ...so logistically, they know everything. In some cases, they know better than the travel agency how to book a ticket or they know better than the agency how to book a hotel or roam around the city from one place to another. So my idea is, if you give the basic idea, but in a proper way, that will help everyone who's coming, [best guess: irrespective] of this holy journey. So I don't mind having the information for how to book a ticket or whatever. And also, a lot of people, I found, confused, even though they were given information how to pack or how to prepare for the Mina days or for Arafat days or how to be, you know, get prepared for visiting the Rawdah or stuff like that. So in those parts, if you put, like, \"Okay, what to keep in mind logistically,\" and something like spiritually, there's something you can consider. But I don't mind if it's a super equipped app, but it has to be navigated, it should be designed such a way it's in-depth but it's straightforward, concise. It's not too much detail because a lot of people, they get lost if it's super extensive, you know.\n[Segment 44] Mahmud Iqbal Halim: I mean, you should let people explore themselves if they want to deep dive or if they want to just, you know, know the basic. So that's like a pricing strategy you can put forward. Okay, if you want to deep dive, you have to pay, and if you just want to know the basic, with the basic... For example, like in Hajj, there are in total nine actions you need to do. So those are basic. If you do the nine, you don't need to worry about the other thing. And if you purify these nine things, you have to deep dive. And, you know, there are a lot of scenarios where the Sharia has some space to differ in between madhab or stuff like that. Because I experienced like people are, some people are offering Dhuhr prayer and some people are offering like the Dhuhr regular prayer when the Hajj days. So they're like, you know, that's like another discussion. But what I'm trying to say here, if you want to make it bigger, you can make it robust, but the basic information should be covered. That's the thing. I don't mind having logistics information upfront for me. Because for me, if the logistics are taken care of, I can focus more on the Ibadah.\n[Segment 45] Muhammad: Okay, Muhammad, thank you very much for your time. It has been really wonderful talking with you. We learned some valuable insight from you and your perspective. May Allah reward you for your time, and may Allah give you reward of Hajj and also may Allah allow you to do Umrah again.\nMahmud Iqbal Halim: It's all my pleasure, and for your initiative. I believe a lot of people will be benefited in coming days. Like, I got a lot of insights and benefits from your idea, even though it was not in the app mode, like in a fully operational mode. But I pray so that it can be a good one, like people can benefit from, inshallah.\n[Segment 46] Muhammad: Okay."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad:  This meeting is being recorded. Uh, thank you for uh joining in this um interview. Uh, we would like to get your opinion as someone who has performed uh multiple times Omrah and Hajj very recently uh to analyse some of the challenges you have faced uh during your journey that we can solve using uh technology, particularly AI and machine learning. Right. Uh, so first, I think it’s better to start with a short introduction. So, uh, as I um, like, we have brother Mohammed Kibria. So, brother, can you um, maybe uh, share a bit about your journey? Uh, how old were you when you did the journey, and which year was it, and maybe um, who travelled with you in some of the last journeys you have?\nKibria:  Salaam alaikum. Um, thanks for for this uh, uh, invitation to discuss about some of my experiences. So, my name is uh, MD Gulam Kibria. I'm originally from Bangladesh but uh, I've been living in Canada for the last 18 years. Um, so I am now 40, 42 years old. Um, I did my uh, first time like Omrah in 2022 with my wife. Um, so that was, so basically just after COVID, um, and then very recently, this year actually, I performed Hajj with my wife as well. Um, so yeah, overall, um, I mean, I learned, of course, a lot of things the first time when I went there. That time we arranged everything, basically from hotel booking to visa and everything. Um, I did it everything from uh, from here. Um, and then we basically uh, we spent about two weeks uh, during that Omrah time. It was quite busy that time because it was just after the COVID. Um, but I think that was really helpful for me to prepare for the Hajj because uh, um, a lot of things, at least the area where I'm going to stay and the surrounding area. So, that was very familiar to me. It was very um, easy for me to go from one place to the other. Um, but in brief, yeah, that was the first time and then very recently I spent 20 uh, 25 days uh, in Makkah and Medina. I um, travelled with a group from Dhaka uh, with a group of people, more than 200 probably. So, it was it was a really good experience. Maybe I can stop here and then anything specific you want to draw.\nMuhammad:  Yeah. So, for example, uh, like first time you did it by yourself, and uh, then uh, this time for Hajj obviously you have to travel with a group. So, can you share uh, next time, inshallah, when you are planning to do Omrah, would you prefer to go with a travel agency or go by yourself and why?\nKibria:  Uh, probably I will prefer to do everything by myself because um, as I said, I know um, the rituals, what to do, and um, also I can book a hotel and I can get a visa with my Canadian passport, it's even easier. So, I don't see anywhere I need uh, help from a travel agency. So, as I mentioned, even for the very first time when I went there, I did it myself, um, together with my wife. So, um, of course, there were areas because I was not sure how far we were staying and all these things. But now I'm quite uh, comfortable that I, I'll be able to go by myself with my family. Inshallah, I'm planning to go uh, with my kids as well if Allah allows uh, next time. Um, but yeah, that's that's my plan. But for Hajj, I think it's definitely uh, we need to go with a group of people. Um, but Omrah, probably, it's it's it's not um, required, at least for for ourselves.\nMuhammad:  Okay. So, when you do the Omrah by yourself, like, what are some of the most challenging things you have faced and how did you resolve this? Like, share like your experience as a first timer when you did your Omrah for the first time, right?\nKibria:  Yeah, sure. So, first time, uh, I was quite overwhelmed with that area. It was so, so, I mean, big area, and I was not sure where I am, I am right now, because uh, it was a little bit uh, yeah, just after COVID, and I went there and that time it was, the crowd was so big that time uh, because a lot of people were waiting for to perform Hajj and Umrah, and they could not go due to the COVID. So, and once they opened, there were like so many people there, so, and it was in Ramadan, so it was even more crowded, right? So, uh, I remember when I went there, we were living a little bit far from from uh, from Haram. It was probably um, probably uh, 25, 30 minutes or so. And um, so my experience, first experience was like, okay, um, the hotel management was definitely not not as cooperative as I was expecting. Um, there was supposed to be a shuttle bus. Sometimes the shuttle bus comes, if they come there, then I can go to the, to Haram, otherwise I have to take a taxi. So, it was not very uh, well organized, I would say, um, and partly because the hotels are a little bit far. So, if next time if I go, definitely I will not stay far from the Haram because it, it becomes very difficult to perform uh, five prayers, right? Uh, other than that, um, like, um, I was not prepared for, for example, when I was doing Tawaf on the mat, so of course it was easy. And then when in the second floor, we, we thought, okay, we'll do it in the second floor, and then the second floor, we didn't realize that it's almost like a 7 km. So, that time we, we had a lot of speed. We thought, okay, we'll do it. But after we finished, my wife was literally put on walk. I was like, okay, right? Because um, she was, she didn't even realize that she is walking so much, uh, right? So, uh, and this time when I went for Hajj, then I told her, do you want to do the Tawaf in the second floor, right? Because again, you need to prepare yourself otherwise don't go there, right? So, those things I think it would be nice to get prepared that okay, what you are going to do and how long is it going to take and all these things. The preparation, mental preparation and physical preparation, I think those are very important, we, um, it's very important. I realized that when in, in Canada, we don't walk too much, like, I'm sitting in my office for the whole day and then literally walking to, and even when I'm going to the mosque, it's just 5 minutes drive. So, I'm not walking at all. So, that was, I found, not uh, not good at least when you are going to Hajj and Umrah, you need to, you need to walk a lot, right? So, and um, so if, if I knew, maybe I had to prepare for that, and and that was also difficult at the first time. Um, but everything went well when I went for the Hajj this time, because I was with the group, so I know where they are going and where I need to go, and I was a bit mentally prepared. Okay, this this ritual I, I need at least this amount of time for Safa and Marwa, then I, I need probably one or two hours at least. So, those kind of things, it helps if you prepare with that, what you are going to do.\nMuhammad:  Like, you have like a quite an amazing experience. Um, I'm curious like first time when you booked the hotel, uh, which portal you booked the hotel from, when you—\nKibria:  I think it was Booking.com.\nMuhammad:  Okay. So, did they advertise like the bus with the hotel will have shuttle?\nKibambia:  Yeah, they said that there will be shuttle bus. Uh, but then the first thing when I went there, they said there's no reservation. I was like, no way. I showed them the paper from Booking.com and uh, and then they somehow managed that. But then there were some issues with the shuttle bus. Okay. Um, it was not well organized, that's what I, I would say. They, they had shuttle bus, but not that, not that frequently or not.\nMuhammad:  So, have you not checked like the review of previous people who uh, booked this hotel uh, from Booking.com and so on?\nKibria:  I prob, I think usually for buying anything I check online some reviews and so on, but in the review sometimes it's not very helpful because you can get all these different types of comments. Oh, these are good, some people have good experience, some people have bad experience. Like in, in Amazon when you buy something, um, of course we look at the ratings and the reviewers, I mean, the customers' feedback, but um, sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. Okay. Uh, so uh, regarding um, like Ramadan, it's actually a very tough time to go on. Uh, so um, and alhamdulillah, like Allah was able to solve you um, those challenges. I'm just curious, were you able to do any uh, Ziyarah, like visiting uh, various uh, places uh, like in uh, in Makkah and Madina?\nKibria:  Yeah. Yeah. We uh, we took a kind of a, a taxi that time. Um, and that uh, it was a Bangladeshi guy. So, he was, he was taking us to um, most of the common places, like um, you go for Ziyarah in in Makkah, probably not not really. But in Madina we went uh, for Ziyarah. In, in Makkah, I don't know why we didn't go um, but I mean, there are not many places outside of Makkah actually. So, but in in in Madina there are, there are a couple of places. So, we went there with with a, with a taxi. Um, yeah.\nMuhammad:  Okay. Um, so when it comes to online hotel booking like Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia, they are very uh, popular one but there are other smaller vendors as well, right? So, for example, if we started a new uh, booking portal focusing on Hajj and Umrah, would it, would it take for you to have like the same trust as like Booking.com or Expedia.com with the portal?\nKibria:  Um, if it is, first of all, if it is new, then um, like for example, with Booking.com, I have booked many times, so I know um, that they are reliable. So, reliability, I think, is very important that I don't want to be a surprise, though I booked and then when I go there, um, I don't see my booking or reservation, right? So, that reliability and trust is important, and for any new like a portal, it will take some time for sure to to build that trust and customer feedback. So, um, but if I know that who uh, let's say this portal is managed by a certain group that I know of, right? Like they are well reputed there in in in the Muslim community for example, right? So, then I know, okay, this is a place I can trust. So, I can definitely love to go and see and of course if someone has gone through them and get some their feedback, so that will make me comfortable that, okay, uh, it's it's reliable. Um, so I think that's most important. Other than that, um, the price that I see in Booking.com, there are so many options. If I see that uh, in a new portal, um, that would be also good. Um, yeah. Um, other than that, the accessibility, I just want to make sure the portal is operating, right? There's no issues with the portal. It's always accessible and so on. Yeah, these are definitely most, most important.\nMuhammad:  I see. No, that's definitely makes sense. Um, in terms of um, Ziyarah, uh, you say like you took a Bangladeshi taxi driver uh, who didn't show you that much in Makkah but in Madina I think it was—\nKibria:  Medina. Yeah.\nMuhammad:  So, how was your experience with transportation from airport to Makkah, Madina, and also like um, other transportation? How was the transportation? How does it, was it easy or you feel like there are lots of uh, sketchy practices in the transportation sector?\nKibria:  Um, in like from Jeddah to Makkah airport. Um, so, so that like I, so it's more like you have to uh, like every taxi driver, they have their own prices, though. So, that is no kind of a standard practice. So, and that is I think it's not good for any foreigner, someone going there for the first time. I'm not sure how much it should, what is actually the, it, the range should, should be the, the, the price should be. The fare, like I was not very sure, is it like 300 Riyal or is it 100 Riyal or 200 Riyal? So, um, so if there is a standard practice, okay, the fair rate is, let's say, 200 Riyal from Makkah, from Jeddah to Makkah or Makkah to Jeddah. So, these kind of things I found is, is not standardized and that becomes problematic for anyone new to this, that area. And the second thing is also for the taxi drivers within Makkah and Madina, it's so much like you have to bargain and uh, sometimes they ask maybe two, three times more than what is the actual fare, and and depending on uh, if you know how far you are going and those things, you have to bargain. And again there is no uh, such practice or any um, they have these meters, but I don't, I have not seen anyone following the meter. So, if there is any anything like that that would be definitely better for any visitors. Um, between Makkah and Madina, we took a train, the bullet train, and that was I think very good experience to be honest. It was really good. Two hours and we, we were in Madina. Um, so the journey was really good. Um, no problem at all. But the same thing as I said, in Madina, uh, the taxi drivers were not very, a lot of them of course they don't speak English. That's a big problem and we don't speak Arabic so the communication gap was there but overall I would say the fair practice was not there. If there is any way to standardize it, um, that will help digital for sure.\nMuhammad:  No, I think that makes sense. So, brother Kibria, uh, based on um, like your experience with Omrah and technology, what is your thought on where technology can come in and solve this problem? Like from hotel booking, you're already using technology but in your, but you faced some difficulty, so maybe share um, how you think this could be better and what are some of the things Booking.com should have. Uh, then, secondly, um, for your experience with Tawaf, Sa'i, all of this local information, how are the things that you think that are the things you think technology can solve then problems with, right? Uh, and information and Ziyarah, all of these things you have done. So, maybe share your insight, how you think this might make better.\nKibria:  Um, well, from the technology side, um, for example, things like um, uh, for transportation, if I talk about it specifically for transportation, um, what I heard is that Uber doesn't work that time. So, I find Uber is very easy to work, I mean, use, and to to call a taxi. And it's it's that's what I use here in Canada, right? Um, but during the Hajj time, someone was telling me that you cannot find Uber at this particular time but before and after it is open or something like that. So, I would really love to see some app where you can just call a taxi through your app. The rate is fixed so you don't have to even talk about it. You can see the fare. So, some if there is any sort of app that can do the job, that will be fantastic. Second thing, through that app you can book uh, local transportation, for example, Makkah bus. So, I was really having issue to pay for the Makkah bus because um, uh, like my credit card. So, initially there was some issue with my um, not the credit card. So, they had, I forgot exactly what was the issue, but I was not able to pay uh, the exact fare in Makkah bus. So, that's a local transportation, right? So, um, but then I was able to uh, pay through, oh, I remember now. Um, because I was using my Bangladesh SIM and uh, when I'm trying to pay my with my credit card, they were trying to send a PIN number to my Canadian phone number, and I am not using my Canadian phone number, right? So, they were, they were not able to verify is it authentic transaction or not. So, I was really having trouble to pay um, to buy ticket for Makkah bus. But luckily I was able to pay with Apple app, uh, Apple, Apple uh, yeah, Apple tap or Apple Pay, sorry, Apple Pay. So, with Apple Pay I, I uh, my credit card information was there, so I was able to pay. So, if there is an app that can kind of reconcile all this transportation in one place. So, if I need to buy a ticket to uh, go take a local transportation, I would be able to do that. If I want to buy, get a taxi, I would be able to get do that. So, from the transportation side, maybe there is a way to reconcile in one app and through that you buy whatever you want, even train ticket and so on.\nMuhammad:  Just to interrupt one thing. So uh, so for transportation uh, there is some regulation that uh, there in Makkah. So uh, incorporating all into one app like booking, what if the app supports you with information? Right. So if you say you want to go to point A to B, it will tell you a price range, it will like you can take Makkah bus. Same way like a guide will tell you, like you, like—\nKibria:  Right. Yeah.\nMuhammad:  So, you're not able to book it but you will get the information like if—\nKibria:  That also, that also helps to to a lot uh, because then I know um, like what is the, where is the actual place where I need to buy ticket because I was asking the bus driver and he is talking in Arabic. Ticket. I, I was not sure how to buy ticket. So, yeah, if the information is already there in the app, then I know where to go and where to buy ticket. Um, so yeah, so that that thing um, same for transportation between Makkah and Jeddah and then Makkah to Madina. If there are ways, um, of course train is good but a bit expensive for some people, right? Um, so if there is any app where you can book uh, like there are a lot of local um, like a taxi drivers who who would go between Makkah and Madina but is there, if there is any app where you you can just book them otherwise you have to wait in on the street and then ask for uh, like, like those drivers who want to go to Madina. Um, yeah so that's pretty much uh, from the transportation side. Um, on the actual like rituals I think um, again if we can put all the information in in the app for example uh, I was uh, I found that book that we got from shepherd handy where there they have lot of or most of the duas um, that are mentioned in Quran and in Hadith, right? So, literally because I don't remember all of these duas but I, when I was uh, because there are so many places where you can you can make dua for a long time and you run out of your duas, right? So, I found that book very handy when I can see all my duas in one place. So, if you can put those duas in in the app and then I can just go through that so I know that I I, I kind of uh, prayed or recited all those duas. So, that will be at least a peace of mind for me that I'm not missing out anything. Same thing in in Arafah because people run out of duas, right? So, those people will find it very handy when they have all the duas mentioned in Quran and also in Hadith. So, I was literally taking that book and um, all the time with me. So, if it is in the phone, definitely it will be easier. Um, and then uh, just to uh, so one of the solution we are thinking of to help people juggle their memory, we are actually creating like an AI chatbot that will have like a natural conversation with you and it will ask people like what do you want, maybe it will remind you how you want to envision yourself after your death, how you want to see your children, what are some of your immediate life goals, where you go settle, right? It will, Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala does not forbid us to ask from dunya, He encourages us through Quran and the Sunnah, Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, to ask a good life in dunya and akhirah as well.\nMuhammad:  So if an AI chatbot can converse with you and coach you how to get the right dua, do you think that'd be helpful inshallah and it also like using the Sunnah of making dua, it will augment it so using like right names of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, using the name of like the sending salutations, Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, those things, do you think that would be helpful?\nKibria:  That uh, Um, that could be one way but I think like if you categorize them, for example, in the Nusuk app, I found it is very useful that like um, duas for, let's say, uh, for Shifa, right? So, there are a couple of duas categorized them, right? So, I don't have to ask the chatbot and, okay, which one I should, I can, I, I already know there are five duas there, I will go through that, right? So, if there is any any way to already put it there and you can keep the chatbot option that okay, you can, if someone wants to ask anything uh, for example, about Ruqyah, if you have some and some duas, okay, which duas I should be reciting. So, and then have it uh, as I say in the Nusuk app, I think it's very nicely organized in in a way that, okay, it is categorized based on the need, so that's that could be other option to think about. Um, same thing in in, there are a couple of good things I found in Anusuk app. The Qibla direction is quite helpful if you're travelling a lot, right? Um, I found it is, it works pretty well. Like a lot of these Qibla apps don't work but this one I found is working pretty well. Same thing um, prayer time, uh, let's say you are travelling with your with the app and you are you are uh, travelling to Paris and then let's say the app will be updated automatically where based on your location and it will tell you what is the prayer time. So, those things uh, again there are other apps but if you want to make it uh, embedded in your app, that's that's quite helpful. At least I, I use it after coming back from Hajj. I still use them for those particular things when I need to know uh, like Qibla direction, as I said, the number of Tawafs there, so those are very helpful. Um, and then on the visual side. Um, I think it's, it's not too complicated. Initially I thought, okay, what, what are the steps? How do we do that? But when we did that, I found it's, it's not, it's not complicated. You just have to follow those five days of uh, rituals and but if if you want to consolidate that in in an app, okay, day one, these are the activities. So, you have to do this, day two, day three, day four and day five. Right. And um, anything associated that you need for that day. Um, for example um, when you are going for to uh, Jamarat for um, for a stone throwing a stone, right? So, if there is any, anything, any context, if you can, if you want to add, let's say someone wants to know a little bit more about that. So, if there is any way that you can click and then go to that place, okay, what happened here and why we do that? So, some sort of uh, you know, a lot of people they don't know even why they are throwing stone, right? So, if if if you think that can add value, maybe it will add some value that okay, some people, so this is why uh, we need to do this and uh, what what is the story behind this, right? So, what happened in this place and that place, those could be uh, some, some small things but could be useful. Um, what else that comes to on top of my head but now but um—\nMuhammad:  What about the training itself, right? So, so I, I would expect, right? So, before going to Hajj, uh, you know, like you are doing the training online, uh, to understand like logistics—\nKibria:  Oh, yes, yeah. Okay, yeah, that's something I forgot. Uh, so what happened is that uh, there was probably 12 or 13 training sessions, right? And those training sessions it was definitely very informative. It's helpful but the problem was there are so many, it's a day long for us. It was not easy because it starts at night and then finishes in the in the morning, right? So, the timing was definitely doesn't work for us. But for the training, those can be consolidated in in a, in a way that, okay, these are the takeaway points or these are uh, maybe some short clips which where you summarize everything because there's no point of putting all these videos in a in an app, right? Because if someone wants to see that they can go to YouTube and so on. But maybe a short version of that or maybe the key takeaway points that we discussed if anyone wants to understand or learn more, maybe they can go to somewhere here or there, right? But the app could like basically if someone goes through the app and those takeaway points, they will not miss out anything, right? But of course, it's not enough if someone wants to know more. There are other places to do that um, because again is, yeah, those I think that would be helpful. Um, I tried to attend a couple of them but again there are um, those are again those are helpful but it's too long for, because there are a lot of discussions happening with in that room and it's not uh, easy for us to understand what's going on in because those online sessions um, is probably good for people who are attending in person but not those for who are joining online so many times that there's a break one hour break to like for prayer and so on but then we are sitting here, right? So, I think there could be a way to make it more shorter versions of those ones with some more like the information that you really they need to need and yeah, so that that's what I think.\nMuhammad:  And um, you said brother you also use the Nusuk app after Hajj as well. So, uh, what like and you use it for prayer time, dua and Qibla direction. So, I think what would be a great after Hajj app would be, so if you're looking for an after Hajj app feature, what would be your uh, thought? Uh, after Hajj prayer, uh, sorry, after Hajj um, things that we should uh, we should practice on our daily life, maybe things those are as a reminder, um, right? So, there are a lot of discussions from scholars that what to do after Hajj, right? Um, so it, it can come handy if if there, there is kind of a um, what is that called, um, uh, sort of reminders that come in your app, right? There are many apps that bring that gives you some reminders. So, maybe those tips uh, on a daily basis, daily tips or something that comes up, pops up in your in your phone. Um, of course it starts with five times prayer in the mosque and then um, like treating everyone nicely and those kind of things. So, um, probably that's most important so that we do not lose the spirit of Hajj and um, right? So, that's that's very important um, things that that that we should avoid um, right? Uh, staying, staying away from sin. So, what are the typical common um, sins that people do, uh, backbiting, those kind of things? Try to avoid those things, right? Um, so do not get into unnecessary discussions, talks or it's useless talks and so on. I, I think probably some useful tips that that are important are to remind everyone on a daily basis.\nMuhammad:  I see, that is uh, very helpful. So, brother, if there is an app that contains all of these things uh, and also combines your hotel booking as well. So, for example like an AI online travel guide. So, for example, the same way you travel with someone, that person maybe an elder brother or like elder that reminds you and gives you in every step and that app will do the same like a travel companion. Do you think it would add value for you and would you be willing to pay for such a solution?\nKibria:  I think so, if it it serves my purpose, it, it helps me to um, give some guidance in terms of okay, do do this and do that. So, with all this information, sometimes even uh, I think I can think of uh, asking that, asking AI, okay, um, what to do in this situation? Basically, there are so many Q&A that I found also helpful in that in that booklet that we got from from Shepherd, right? So, there are so many questions and answers, they're already there and these are common questions, right? So, but it's always good that if I ask a chatbot and basically it will be connected with those answers, you don't have um, uh, like it's not some random answers, it's basically authentic answers, okay, in this situation what should I do, right? So, and then the AI will tell us, okay, uh, based on this um, like an authentic information from here and here, this is you should do, so then it's definitely quite helpful for me and I don't have to uh, look for another place or look someone, ask someone what to do and so on. You find it as a handy um, like as I said, some of the questions are very common, right? So, yeah, it can be quite come as handy and yeah, I'm sure it um, like if we find it useful, we, we pay for so many things, we pay for Google Drive, we pay for this and that, right? So, definitely you'll be happy to pay for those kind of solutions.\nMuhammad:  And how much you, you may be willing to pay? Like the amount, monetary amount? What do you think would be the right amount?\nKibria:  I don't know. Um, if I just compare with some of the other apps I am paying for example, um, ChatGPT $20 USD per month um, and then Google, sorry, Dropbox for example, it's it's not, I mean typical app, but I'm just saying they are providing some service, right? So, in that sense, um, $13, $14 USD per month. Right. Um, Google, I probably pay $4, $5, much cheaper. So, somewhere I would say um, I don't know, $5 to $10 is probably is a lot of people will not find it anything. I mean, it will be quite easy to pay for these kind of things.\nMuhammad:  Okay. So, something like maybe $15 one-time fee and afterwards for reminder duas, like reminder—\nKibria:  Maybe two per month if somebody want to—\nMuhammad:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. During the Hajj time I think someone can pay more because those will be useful. After Hajj you can, there are different rates, something like that. Yeah.\nMuhammad:  Yeah. Um, and Kibria, like alhamdulillah you've done Hajj a few months back. How are you feeling? Sorry if it's a sensitive question, if you don't want to, you can skip that. But just for research purpose, how do you feeling? Like the spirituality factor is there and uh, what are some of the challenges you face? Uh, so do you think this is uh, and what are the techniques you are using to have the spirit of Hajj within you and like a different life that you like live before Hajj. So that's the last question basically.\nKibria:  Sure. Um, yeah, also a difficult question as well, right? Um, well, I spiritually um, I don't know how much I have changed um, uh, Well, I, I definitely something is different before and after um, in terms of my overall feeling for for the Deen, how I practice Deen and how I teach Deen to my kids, to my family. So, I definitely have a different viewpoint at this point like especially um, when we're living abroad in a Western country, right? So, the way I look at uh, like the worldly life versus my practicing my Deen, right? So, prioritizing my daily, I mean, my job versus prioritizing my Deen. So, I think the balance has gone towards more towards practicing and inclining towards the Deen where what I used to do before. Uh, for example, sometimes I am too much busy with meetings and so on, and now I'm trying to take breaks when it's a time for prayer, I'm really trying to do that, right? So, um, when it's time for prayer, so I, I cannot delay my prayer because it is important to pray at, at the beginning of the time, right? So, um, similarly like missing our prayers in in the mosque, again it's some, we always have excuse in Western country, it's a little bit far, it will take 10 minutes to go there and so on and so forth. So, um, so again it's, is how you prioritize this one, right? So, if it is 10 minutes but you are spending 10 minutes for your Deen, for for praying in the mosque, which is which is much better than praying at your home, right? So, um, Yeah, alhamdulillah. I, I think I uh, I'm trying uh, at least I have, as I said, my uh, thought process has changed especially when it comes to teaching my kids and I'm honestly thinking and putting my thoughts on whether I should really stay in in this country or I should go back, right? So, because this thought I didn't have before going to Hajj. After coming almost every day we were talking at home that probably this is not not the right environment uh, to grow kids, to to raise kids here because of so many factors, right? And and at the same time when in parallel when I'm looking at my my uh, my nephews who are growing up in in Bangladesh in they are they they are um, studying in Madrasah very well um, uh, organized and so on uh, until one of them became Hafiz already, the second one is studying there. So, I see their manner versus the manners of the kids here. So, I could see a vast difference, right? So, yeah, after coming back, I'm really putting more thoughts whether what's the best approach here because I'm not sure um, um, pray for me so that I take that I, I right decision what's the best for me for my Deen, for my family. But this is something I, as I said, before Hajj, I was not serious about it, but after Hajj, maybe Allah has given me something in my mind that has changed my the way of thinking. So, so yeah, that's that's pretty much um, the realization if you like to say um, in in like before and after coming back from Hajj.\nMuhammad:  Yeah. So, dua, inshallah, I will sincerely be making dua, like Allah give you and all of us like righteous family and Allah guide you whatever is uh, best for your family. Um, thank you, Kibria. Um, I think I got lots of valuable insight from you and I think I got uh, lots of um, uh, support uh, through your interview. It's very inspiring. Inshallah um, feel free to reach out if you have any idea, anything, any suggestion for me for this app. Inshallah please share with me. Inshallah this would be a very good effort. So, with that, inshallah, I'd like to thank you for your time and for sharing this interview. Salaam.\nKibria:  Thank you so much for the interview and I think what you are doing is is definitely could be quite impactful for the um, uh, and uh, I can see that that you have the right intention to really help people. So, uh, with that, it can be quite valuable. It can come very handy for a lot of people who are going there for the first time, who doesn't know um, what to do and where to start. It can be quite helpful and yeah, jazakallah khair for for taking that initiative.\nMuhammad:  Okay. Okay. Thank you very much."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: Salamu Alaikum Jishan Bhai, how are you?\nJishan: Assalamu Alaikum, Alhamdulillah, I am fine.\nMuhammad: Alhamdulillah. Jishan Bhai, I think I gave you the context before, but now I'll give it formally. Last month, I joined an entrepreneurship studio named 'Hasan Di'. From that perspective, I am trying to start a startup focusing on Hajj and Umrah. So far, from the validation I've done, I think the initial idea, Insha'Allah, will be like Trip Advisor, but focusing on Hajj and Umrah. It will promote Hajj and Umrah agents, as well as local service providers, so that people can avail some services even if they go by themselves. Later on, Insha'Allah, once the business is a bit established, I might move towards an OTA (Online Travel Agency) where people can directly book hotels, flights, and everything through my platform, because to do an OTA, one needs to gain some trust from people. And another option is to create a Trip Advisor-like system focusing entirely on the halal travel segment. For example, if someone goes to Sri Lanka or Indonesia – everything in Indonesia is halal – but if someone goes to Sri Lanka or Thailand, what are the halal options? Which places can be visited? We are working on such a concept, or these are long shots. Since, Alhamdulillah, you performed Hajj in 2002 and also Umrah afterwards, we are interviewing you for this reason, Insha'Allah. So, Bhai, let's start. Could you briefly share your Hajj and Umrah experience and give a brief introduction of yourself?\nJishan: Okay, Assalamu Alaikum everyone. I first performed Umrah in 2017, okay? I did it through a small agency. Before that, I didn't have much idea. One of my friends, since he had done Umrah before, I basically went with them to perform Umrah. So, what they showed us there, they mainly booked our air ticket and hotel. The rest, we coordinated ourselves after reaching there. The major gap I felt after my first visit was that we didn't go knowing much about Hajj or Umrah at that time. Or we couldn't study, I mean, we didn't study enough. Actually, since I was working then, I mean, it even happened that I went to Thailand for a district conference. From Thailand, I flew at night and went for Umrah. So, what happened was, I couldn't really mentally concentrate on it. Since I didn't study, what happened was, the people I went with, they guided me and my wife. They did it in their way. We didn't have anyone with us, I mean, it's not like we had a guide or anything. It was not individual. Back then, there was a system where you had to go under some 'mualim' (guide), so we went that way. The major thing is that for the first time, it felt good. When I first went to Madinah, and from there, we later went to Makkah by road. So, perhaps every experience was new for me. So, it felt really good. But what happened was, since I hadn't studied beforehand, I didn't quite understand which supplication (dua) should be recited where, or what the significance of certain places was. I didn't know about the rest. When I went there, I remembered, \"Oh, yes, I read this in my childhood, this is the place of the Companions.\" When I went there, \"Oh, okay, people think they can see graves if they peek inside,\" but actually, you can't see them. And back then, I didn't even know that there are three graves there, and two more Caliphs' graves are there. Seeing these things, I was happy for the first time. When I first went to Makkah, and from there, the first time seeing the Kaaba Shareef – I even feel that if a non-Muslim person were shown it, the initial impact would be significantly positive. So, for us, who are practicing Muslims, it felt really, really good. But what happened was, as I felt, the 'sahih tarika' (correct method) that we understand, I couldn't really grasp it fully. So, later I made many mistakes or should have done things the right way, or perhaps spent more time in certain places. So, those things were missing for me. Immediately after returning, in 2018, I went in December, I came back in January 2017. As soon as I returned, in 2018, I registered for Hajj for 2020, both my wife and I. The first Umrah you chose was\nMuhammad: Yes, you went for the first Umrah in 2017, right?\nJishan: I went in December 2017, but actually returned in the first week of January 2018.\nJishan: Okay, so when I came back around March-April, we first started looking for whom to go with. Because I wanted a group or people who would provide learning, not just typically manage Hajj. They would actually impart the knowledge. So, that's why we registered with Shepherd's Hajj then.\nMuhammad: Okay, how did you find Shepherd's? Of Shepherd's?\nJishan: Well, regarding Shepherd's, since we were doing some research ourselves, back then, seven years ago, there weren't many reels or similar content. We basically saw Dr. Manjur Elahi in some Q&A sessions. So, he had mentioned somewhere that in certain cases, he performs Hajj with some groups as a Shariah consultant and goes with the caravan. So, he mentioned Shepherd's at that time.\nMuhammad: Okay, so your main selling point was not Shepherd's or the agency or a referral, you wanted to perform Hajj with Sheikh Manjur Elahi?\nJishan: Exactly.\nJishan: I felt that if I go with him, I will be able to perform Hajj in the right and proper way. He will give me the right education.\nMuhammad: And your main goal here was to go with a group from which you could properly perform Hajj.\nJishan: Yes.\nJishan: I wanted to perform a Mabroor Hajj (accepted Hajj). My parents went for Hajj in 2007. I forget which caravan it was, BGM or some other caravan. They only went once or twice for the initial training sessions provided by the agency. But that training was more of an administrative training.\nJishan: It wasn't really educational, or they just gave a book. They said, \"Read this book.\" It was a small booklet, the kind that's available now. They sat down to read that book. For me, it wasn't like that. Since I had some... that's why I registered for 2020, not 2018 or 2019.\nJishan: I thought we should take some time to study. Since we were working, we couldn't always manage everything. So, that was a very right decision. I felt it was important to go with the right people and have the right kind of group. Not like, I'm going with a good group, but the mentality of the majority doesn't match. I remember Dr. Manjur mentioned that they don't take very large Hajj caravans. They try to take people with whom they feel they have the right mentality. He gave an example that they would never allow any woman to register without a Mahram (unmarriageable kin). Okay? Like, sometimes it happens, \"Okay, you're going with them.\" For example, what happened with my parents, I'm sorry, my aunts. My aunt went for Hajj, she didn't go with anyone, [best guess: meaning] because the caravan told her, \"It's not a problem.\" Okay? So, if there are small mistakes like this, which are very grave errors, then my Hajj won't be correct. So, for that reason, I wanted to go with people who – he said, \"I, and Dr. Zakaria, we all take classes occasionally. We prepare them by taking classes.\" So, because of that, after 2020, Hajj didn't happen due to Covid. 2021 didn't happen either. So, we continued to attend classes with them. When we went for Hajj in 2022, we had already attended more or less over 20 Hajj classes with them. During Covid, they continued conducting classes online after the first two months. This gave me a lot of comfort, actually. And what felt right was that it gave me significant comfort knowing that I was going with knowledge. It's like going to an exam well-prepared, with comfort, knowing that you can do it, at least ask all the right questions. But whatever I do, I will do it the right way. I feel that confidence was built, and we were able to go for Hajj. As much as I know, it's up to Allah. And because of this, I think I prepared myself a lot, which I hadn't done before. Because when I went for Hajj, I tried to keep a few things in mind that people said. I remember, since many people gave classes, I don't remember who said what. For example, there was a brother who kept saying, \"The biggest thing here is to bear everything with sabr (patience), bear everything with sabr.\" You have to endure everything, do everything. And remember, if you do even a small good deed, if you are in Madinah, you will get a hundred thousand times the reward. I was prepared that whatever I face, whatever seems good, I will keep doing it. This is always an opportunity. That's why we took the full package, almost 41 or 42 days in total. I didn't take any short package. That was a big thing, and in between, I had a big transition. Because I used to work in an organization. I worked for almost 19 years. And I always felt, after talking to the doctors (scholars), that the job I was doing, the product I worked with, [best guess: 'Stapo'] might not be halal (permissible), and through the sessions, I understood that it's actually not halal. Something that harms cannot be halal. By that time, I had worked a lot. I tried to quit my job two or three times during Covid. Then my colleagues told us, \"You can quit when you have time. You need to earn for your family, take care of them. You have made an intention to Allah, He will take care of it.\" Then, what will happen is, you will be able to move on beautifully at some point. So, you can do something, keep the intention. So, I feel Allah heard that too. In 2021, after quitting my job, I went for Hajj in 2022. I tried to pay for Hajj from my earnings from 2021 to 2022. The previous one, whether it was halal or haram, only Allah knows. I didn't do it knowingly. But this time, I paid for Hajj with money earned from a halal job. These things brought a lot of positive impact for me, I felt. I became part of, I mean, by 'part of' I mean, I became a part of this Hajj caravan. As a volunteer, as a guide, as a participant in everything. So, that was very necessary for me, and my experience there was very positive in the context that the people who run or conduct this caravan, they try to help people by understanding their mindset, what should not be done. That doesn't mean they repeat their mistakes. They would often say, \"We don't sell five-star rooms, we sell for Hajj.\" Many people would directly refuse or those who did were well-behaved and very strict. I remember during Hajj, we ourselves had many sessions sitting in the hotel room, discussing what would happen the next day, where we would go, even if we had studied beforehand, things can still go wrong. So, this hand-holding part was a comfort. However, one thing I felt was missing there, it's not about the agency. At that time, we weren't, or now we've become very app-dependent. We trust apps. If something happens, we might search on YouTube or an app. For example, today I was booking a hotel to go abroad. So, I quickly booked with Agoda. So, at that time, I felt that we needed these common things: how the steps of Hajj are performed according to the correct creed. I couldn't find this information in one place. Is this right? Is this wrong? I felt that was very important. It was an added thing that I felt later. Since I went last year, Alhamdulillah, some people are doing it now, but it's not fully there, at least not in Saudi Arabia. There's that app, I forgot its name, Nusuk. The app they started after Covid, where you have to book time in advance to go everywhere.\nJishan: Nusuk, Nusuk, Nusuk, Nusuk, Nusuk app, that gave a comfort. Because I felt, when I went for Umrah for the first time, when I had to queue for the visit, it was chaotic, like a fight. It's not like it is now. Everyone has a slot, they go at their time, sit nicely in one place, then go to the empty area, pray, and then leave. So that's a comfort. But since we didn't understand Arabic much there, many things about Hajj were mentioned, but these pictures, I felt, were not available anywhere. And now, for booking or going, you don't have to go now, they have opened it up. There is a need for this to be comforting. It should include all the local travels. I mean, I want to say that travel within Saudi Arabia should also be comforting. This time, when I went last, for going to Makkah with a guide, I got it through a reference. \"Someone you went with, tell me his number.\" This information is not available anywhere. Instead of taking a taxi from there, if you have a known person, I wouldn't mind paying 50 riyals more. If it's a known person, if there are Bengalis there, many of them do this work, they have their own cars, and they are good profiles, and they seem like guides. Or rather, I felt they were profile-wise right. These things are not available anywhere. Now, if someone goes, I always connect them, \"Go to this person.\" \"This Modhu Bhai is in Makkah, and what's his name? Karim Bhai is in Madinah.\" I follow everyone, I get such good service and a lot of comfort. Then, the train ticket, the bullet train that runs between Makkah and Madinah, that ticketing system is different. It's operated in a way that I couldn't do it myself, so I had to take someone else's support. So, these administrative things can actually be made comforting. Ziyarah (visitations) that happen. There's no list here where I can say, \"I'll call from number five and say I want to go for Ziyarah, how is it?\" This information is not available there. And naturally, we Bengalis look for it. I would say, basically, for the language. So, this information is not available in one place. I feel these things are a gap. If it can be found from somewhere, a lot of people are going from Bangladesh. Now, a lot of people go for Umrah. And I mean, even those who don't practice much, they might also go a lot. The number wasn't so high before. Before, the number was perhaps\nJishan: 10 people or one person would go. Now, 10 people, 3 people are going, whether it's to take their mother, their parents, or for their own desire. Because I don't know, I probably don't have the data, but the young generation now, whether we call them children or not, this generation wasn't there before. Why are they doing it? Whether they practice with informed understanding or not, they try to find it out. They do it. Why do they have to search? Why do I have to land at the airport and stand there? Why won't I know beforehand how many times I will perform Tawaf? Where should I sit? Why isn't that available? When they asked me, \"Brother, why is there no pick?\" I could have said, \"There are many small books. Oh, yes, it's victoried.\" So, reading those books... now people read less paperbacks; everyone searches whether it's available digitally somewhere. That I did this, and what do I do next? Where do I sit? I performed Tawaf seven times, after that, do I drink Zamzam water first or pray two rakats of prayer? Why aren't these things guided? If everything else is there, why won't this be? So, after this, I will run between Safa and Marwa. Should I start from one end? What is the dua for both ends? So, it might be written in books but not digitized. Everyone wants it at their fingertips now. And especially when it comes to admin, meaning the operational things that we need. Even many people go shopping. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Whatever you spend there, Allah will multiply it many times.\" So, when people go there, some go to buy gold, perhaps some ornaments, or naturally, people buy these things more everywhere. Which is a good shop? What is the current rate? Okay? I have very rarely seen people who don't buy these. Small or big, they buy. I wouldn't say they are buying only from Saudi Arabia. I think we also keep in mind what our Noble Prophet said to us. So, I haven't really mentioned specific bullet points, but from the context of experience, I felt there were good things. There have been areas of improvement from our side. The Saudi government is doing things, last time, sorry, I think when we went for Hajj last time, everyone, you can remember, we went from here, we landed and went to a small hotel, then came back. Significant comfort. The first time, I was exhausted just finding my luggage after getting off the plane. The airport provided, another airport was connecting Madinah. These things, these things are positive improvements from their side. They are setting up their things as tourists. Fine. Because I also need my comfort, you know? Hajj is very demanding physically, mentally. So, these other comforts are necessary there. So, if that's there, then I think our worship can be done with a cooler and stronger mind. So, that's what I think.\nMuhammad: Hello, I can hear you. It's a bit low.\nMuhammad: I'll show you a small screen. Before that, could you briefly describe your year's experience, what do you call it, your Umrah Hajj experience? During Hajj, there's a lot of movement, a lot of things. What challenges did you face then?\nJishan: Among the challenges, one is that since we have several places to go and things to do, everyone is a bit like, \"Should I go to Madinah first or Makkah?\" Right? If you're staying in Makkah, where is the best place to stay? From the perspective of accommodation, if I say it first, this area was a challenge: how to minimize movement as much as possible. Okay? Even on the day of Arafat, when we returned to Mina, I felt, we got lost. A bus dropped us off. The bus dropped us at a place. Our Mina camp was quite far away. We had to walk a lot. And we honestly got lost. And we were so tired, because one is already very tired. So, I felt these things, I mean, how to minimize movement. I mean, less movement within hotels. Today from this hotel, tomorrow from that hotel. So, that felt like a big challenge to me. Secondly, what I felt was that, in terms of worship, I didn't face many challenges like that. Because our Sheikh was with us, and the two brothers from our Hajj agency were continuously with us. So, I was able to ask queries whenever I needed to, and we were able to do it beautifully. I think when performing Hajj, for praying Salah, for a long time, for worship, this is a very good opportunity. They (the organizers) try to bring people with the same mindset. This is a big advantage; I felt like we were going as a family. I didn't feel like I didn't know someone. That was a comfort. But again, coming back to the administrative part, meaning, it's a huge thing, so many people go to one place. You can't set up everything perfectly even if you want to. And everything has a price. The price we pay in Bangladesh, perhaps you get the best service for that price. But what happens is, I feel that since we are very dependent on guides or people, often discomfort arises and misunderstandings happen. While it is mentally significantly demanding to stay focused for those 40 days, we commit many sins in this world unknowingly. But there, knowing something is a sin and refraining from it is also a huge mental pressure. I won't gossip, I won't gossip about worldly matters. When we hold ourselves back, it creates pressure for ordinary people like us. Then, small things often lead to misunderstandings, and we make mistakes that might challenge our Hajj from being Mabroor (accepted). So, that comfort is, of course, our own happiness. We are not going there as children; we all went as adults. So, at that time, when I had to handle someone who perhaps didn't like their room and was getting angry, everyone wouldn't be the same. So, that's why these things – expectations should be lowered for people. What happens with a tour, when it's a tour group, they sell it at a high end. Meaning, if they provide service, they sell it saying, \"I'm doing this.\" But for Hajj, if 100% is the actual experience, then it should be sold at 70%. Expectations should be lowered. This becomes a significant challenge for the entire group of pilgrims. When two or three people react like that, or their responses become very sharp, then it impacts the rest. This is what I felt from the mental side. And on the operational side, like repeatedly changing hotels or doing this, it becomes very difficult. Because we carry baggage for 40 days. Backpacks are quite heavy. And since there are so many people there, it's not always like you can just call an Uber. It's not like that. Since everyone stays near the Kaaba, everyone is going there. So, that's a challenge. And the third thing I'll mention is the app, I keep coming back to it because things should be at your fingertips, like FAQs or Q&A. It could be bot-driven or whatever. A lot of questions come up. Because we live in our country, we are not exposed to these things. There's a fear that, \"Did I make a mistake?\" \"Did I do something wrong?\" \"Is something partially wrong?\" \"Do I need to give 'dam' (expiation)?\" These things. Before, everyone had books, perhaps three books. I remember taking almost four or five books. But this information can easily be brought to your fingertips. So, what you said about making dua, which dua should be recited here?\nJishan: Which place is good to read in. Dua is for Allah. All duas are valid. But then there are specific ones: which one to recite. And then one thing I felt was, we perform multiple Umrahs. What's the name of that city? We went to Taif, performed a back-to-back Umrah. Okay? Is this Umrah for oneself or can it be performed for someone else? Can it be done for my deceased parents? Does it make any difference? So, many FAQs, frequent questions, keep swirling in our minds. We might have had access to scholars and could ask them, but then there's still a need for individual mobile devices. Many people who go with family, in multiple groups, they need their phones to stay connected. Everyone carries a small pouch with their mobile. So, if it's there, it's easy. And if the Holy Quran is also there, it's even more convenient. We read the Quran. When we go there, another thing is that we can't read their script because we don't know all the characters; we normally read the Kolikata Babu script more. So, that becomes a single point of contact for me. Meaning, everything in one place. Okay? I stepped out, \"Alright, I have some time after Maghrib, or a gap after Dhuhr. Let me see where I can buy some things, like which shops are good for this?\" Like the gold shop, which one is recommended that sells genuine items? I've seen myself, the same product, a gold coin, the same product, one outlet quotes 4100 Riyals, but then after visiting three shops nearby, it comes down to 3500. So, a 600 Riyal gap. So, we don't really understand the right pricing. Which is correct? Having recommendations for reputable ones is also part of it. It's part of Umrah, Hajj. Buying for the family can be done there. People repeatedly ask, \"Where can I find this?\" \"Where can I find that?\" \"I want to buy a jubba (robe), which brand is good? Or where can I get the right price?\" Pricing varies a lot. \"I want to buy dates. Which market is suggested for buying dates? If I buy less, where can I buy from? If I buy more, where can I go?\" This is a part, it is part of it. All these things can be brought into one place. Of course, the primary focus must be on worship, whether it's Hajj duas, Quran, etc.\nJishan: It must be there. But those things can actually add a lot of value.\nMuhammad: Masha'Allah Jishan Bhai, Alhamdulillah! The things you've said, Alhamdulillah, we are working on exactly those. So, let me share our plan in detail with you, and then you can give some feedback on how we can improve. So, what I'm showing you now is the first version of our app. Here we first have the Umrah Guide. You can see it has Ihram, Tawaf, Sa'i, and the last part, cutting hair. When you start Ihram, it has just brief details about Ihram, what it is, and a mindful track for Ihram. And then you can see the rules: mandatory, Sunnah, then prohibitions. Once you've seen this, and you enter the step, you'll see your part is done. The same for Tawaf. What are the obligations for Tawaf? Everything is listed. How to read [inaudible] was not there, there was no video for Ihram. Insha'Allah, we'll add tutorials. I felt that some things we actually found by searching on YouTube.\nJishan: Hmm hmm hmm.\nMuhammad: Which channel to read. Okay? Which is allowed. Okay? Very basic things.\nJishan: Hmm.\nMuhammad: So, YouTube, especially the part about Ihram for the Kaaba, there are actually many. We found these by searching on YouTube. If these were available, perhaps with links, it would be much easier.\nMuhammad: Insha'Allah. Then, for the Hajj dua spots, where to make supplications, yes, those. And then when you perform Tawaf, it will take you to the Tawaf screen, and you can count your Tawaf there. When you count, you'll see \"for men\" written at the top. And the main things to do for Tawaf, those won't scroll here.\nMuhammad: And you can easily go to the Tawaf guidance. There will be a QR code there, and from there you can go back to the Tawaf screen. And in the same way, you can, if you want to add any duas during your Tawaf, you can add those here. So, you\nJishan: Okay, here, does it have to be done manually? I mean,\nMuhammad: Yes, I did one, two, or three, that.\nMuhammad: It can be done automatically. The problem with automatic is that if there's an error, it will be very costly. Because we prefer to do it manually, we all count by hand or keep track in other ways. That's how it should be. I will read, and since the duas are appearing above, giving reminders repeatedly, people will actually read. This app, as we are thinking about it now, would be very beneficial if someone performs Tawaf on the upper floor or when the mataf (circumambulation area) is empty. But in a crowded situation, doing it with a mobile in hand will be a bit challenging. So, for that, we are planning a control system. If it's an Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch, we are planning to integrate with wearables, Insha'Allah, though that would be a much later version. For now, it's here. And then when you continue Tawaf, you will go to Sa'i. So, when you go to Sa'i, what you need to do, those things are there. And\nJishan: In the completion, was it drinking Zamzam water and praying two rakats?\nMuhammad: If you go to 'Learn', then when you select 'Etiquette and Safety', you'll find the first part. Let me show you, we added Zamzam water in the rulings. For example, you'll see that first, for the Sunnah of Sa'i, you have to have Wudu (ablution), then 'Istilam' (touching or pointing) of the Black Stone, and then when you go to Safa, you climb, recite the dua, and the duas to recite during climbing are also given. I think it wasn't given properly, we'll add it Insha'Allah. You've given good feedback. Since these things are coming up.\nMuhammad: Yes, definitely. So, we will add this, Insha'Allah. Then, if you complete it, you can mark it complete here, and the last part is cutting hair. So, after you cut your hair, this is just a very simple Umrah tracker we've made. And here, for voluntary Tawaf, we've separated the Tawaf module, as many people perform voluntary Tawaf. And there's a Dua Companion here. For now, we'll add some duas for personal, family, and specific needs. But for now, we intend to bring some things from the Nusuk app here. For example, the current Nusuk app, if you look here, if you go to 'Dua', it suggests many types of duas. But it requires internet to run. What happens is, sometimes there's no internet connection there. We are thinking of taking an 'offline first' approach. And what we are planning next is to add an 'Explore' option here. In the 'Explore' option, for example, in Nusuk, these things are mainly in Arabic. I couldn't use that feature properly in my experience.\nMuhammad: If this app, for example, here I set it to English, but after that, if I go to the 'Explore' option, the 'Explore' option remains in Arabic. It's not very beneficial. So, our plan is to\nJishan: And in Arabic, and the script it's written in, I can't actually read that script.\nMuhammad: Exactly, exactly. So, our plan is to make the 'Explore' option like Trip Advisor. So, when it's like Trip Advisor, you'll be able to see all your plans here. We have another option here, for example, you see, it's completely Arabic, not localized like that. This is a new main challenge. Then, it's more for local people, or people. It's not that friendly for external audiences, at least from my personal view. And for flight booking, hotel booking, Haramain train, we plan to bring the OTA option in the future. And what you mentioned about pilgrims staying connected, yes, for that, our plan is to bring a stream, a 'Hajji Stream'. So, what will happen there is, you can say it's like social media, but focusing on Hajj. Those who are performing Hajj together, various scholars, Hajj influencers, local guides from Makkah and Madinah, they will be integrated here. They will share their point of view, their journey. And the benefit of this will be that when you are in Hajj, you can know what's happening around you. Second point, what happens in Hajj is that information is power. For example, if you are going to Jamarat to stone, you don't know the situation of Jamarat now. For example, you might know that in 2024, some accidents happened at Jamarat. Many people died when going from Muzdalifah to Jamarat. To avoid such challenges or health issues, people will be able to communicate within the broader crowd. People can ask, \"What is the situation of Jamarat?\" And when people communicate, we will track all that information. There is no public persona here. The public communications that happen in the forum, we will track those and share some intelligence or summary. What is the current status, what are people saying, and we will share it with everyone in the group. And lastly, what about providers? As you said, local travel agencies, drivers, then guides, or if you book a flight there, or a hotel from there, or if you go to Jeddah, or you travel to Abha through a travel agency, some of these\nMuhammad: Services will be available, and we will encourage localized travel among them. For example, we have a plan to capture the entire halal travel market. But our initial plan is to work with Saudi Arabia plus Makkah and Madinah. And for Ziyarahs (visitations), for example, you may have gone to Taif, then you performed Ziyarahs at various locations in Makkah, and gone to Madinah. But what happens there is, you have to hear everything from a guide. Our plan, Insha'Allah, is to have recorded audio at every place, explaining what each place is for and why. And then, our plan is to go into a contract with the management of the places in Makkah and Madinah. Then, what will happen is, for example, we went to the Darul Madinah Museum. We will have a QR code in our app. So, when you go to the museum, when you come near a display, you can point your phone at that QR code, and you'll be able to see what happened there. If you have headphones, you can listen to what happened there. Then, you won't always need a guide. You'll be able to do these things interactively. Saudi Arabia is having many museums built now. Our plan, Insha'Allah, is to partner with them so that people can learn Islamic history from these museums. And lastly, regarding local recommendations, as you mentioned, where to buy jewelry, where to buy food, where to buy clothes. We intend to indicate all of these, Insha'Allah. This is a huge plan. If Allah allows, then Insha'Allah, it will be possible. But we are moving forward with this in mind. Meaning, Hajj and Umrah should be a complete guide for people. And now, since AI and machine learning are available, it will serve as their travel companion, a virtual AI guide. And last but not least, two important things are Shariah questions. Sometimes, we see that someone had an idea to provide Shariah services. For example, you are in Saudi Arabia, suddenly you are in Muzdalifah, and you have some problem. Now you cannot access a scholar or anyone. You don't know if your action is valid, or if you need to pay 'dam' (expiation). If you knew immediately, it would be easier for you.\nMuhammad: Then you might have something like a call center or a helpline where you call, ask a question. You might get an answer within a specific time, say six hours or three to four hours. You remember we had so many questions in our minds. They will help you find the answers. But it's important not to affect our worship. And at the same time, we follow Islam as Muslims. And it's important that while we follow our own viewpoint, we respect others' viewpoints. For example, for those in Bangladesh who follow the Hanafi school of thought, after stoning at Jamarat on the first day, for the subsequent days of Mina, the Ayyam-e-Tashriq, they don't consider it mandatory or 'wajib' to stay in the tents of Mina. And you will see that the Mina tents are empty on the days after Eid al-Adha.\nMuhammad: Whereas those who are from Ahl-e-Hadith or Hanbali schools of thought, they consider it 'wajib' (obligatory). So, our intention, Insha'Allah, is to enable pilgrims by respecting these things and providing guidance according to each person's school of thought. And lastly, after returning, the plan is to maintain a connection stream. For example, you've performed Hajj and you stay connected. Every year during Hajj season, you might get a notification. You receive some reminders, see some pictures, or when Umrah season comes, you see some reminders, pictures, or you journal your experiences there. These journal entries might remind you in your day-to-day life, or you might make some duas there. When you make those duas through the same app, those memories might come to your mind, and you will perform them accordingly. And regarding the monetization plan we are currently working on, many of these features are already available in other apps or many free apps. The point of our app is that a major portion will be free, but some options will be locked, which will require effort from our side. For example, location-related benefits that are not easily copy-pasted from elsewhere and are not available anywhere else. I will start with a premium model where basic things like rulings will be in the free module. If you buy a premium subscription, you might see more information. And if you hire a guide or a travel agency there, or if you go through a travel agency from Bangladesh, we will charge a commission. So, this is how we are planning the app's monetization. So, this is our plan, Jishan Bhai, what do you think? As a user, would you use the full version of this app or mostly the free version? Providing the full version would involve things like location awareness, which require our server to work continuously. And for things that require our own research and data, like where the market is now, or audio-visual streams for each place from the server, we will charge a fee. What would you do? Would you use the full version or the free version?\nJishan: I actually already gave the answer a bit earlier, regarding the areas I felt needed development.\nJishan: Those things will be in the premium version. All these things, if they are not premium, it's difficult to get resources. Personally, if it were me, I would take the premium service. The exact challenges I faced, I feel that this thing could have made my worship and my whole experience comfortable. If it's a one-time fee, and you won't need it later, or if you go for an Umrah trip once and won't need it after Umrah. If you are charged a one-time fee for it, for which the premium features will be valid for one year, how much would you consider fair in US dollars? That's a challenging question to answer, honestly. For me, the kind of Hajj I personally performed, I mean, staying in front of Haram Sharif (the Grand Mosque), that means all those hotels were pretty much five-star hotels. Although, there, hotels mean distance actually. Closer is better hotel, further is a bit less. And considering the amount of money we spent, if someone charges me 20-25 dollars here,\nJishan: Okay? We often notice when traveling that we pay for insurance when buying plane tickets. Oh, no, they ask why you're buying insurance with the ticket, or why you're booking a hotel. It's a service, or sometimes it's 10 dollars, sometimes 20 to 25 dollars. It shouldn't be. But it will be very much used, if it's used extensively, it might be more expensive. But if it's, if it's an annual fee, then, and this would be for those who are going for Hajj that year. Those who are not going that year won't pay. For the year I go, I think 25 dollars would be major. And secondly, we are planning to have a social stream. It will remain even after Hajj, and people will benefit from it. Hajj memories will be there, people will share them. In this case, if we keep a token fee, say one dollar or two dollars monthly, 100 or 150 Taka, do you think people would be interested in that? Not everyone will be. Because one thing is, the main reason for this connection is if, for example, since we went with Shepherd's, we are connected with Shepherd's. Because Shepherd's themselves try hard to keep them connected. Then what? Many individuals got lost. Now, I remember a Dr. Rifat Bhai, his name was. I haven't seen him since Cox's Bazar. Okay? It happens that many might not value it that much. Okay? In my opinion, perhaps 20-25% of people will actually value it, that I stay, I value it, because I'm already connected. So, I will have it. But regarding the charge, I don't know how to look at it. For example, in the case of Apple phones, I have stored something in my iCloud. Okay? 99 cents a month. I just have a 50GB storage. I don't keep much. My normal phone usually has it. Backup is always needed. Okay? No matter when. So, the minimum is 50GB. It charges 99 cents monthly. I don't really feel it. I don't notice the payment. You actually have to pay it all at once, and then it deducts it slowly from there. So, sometimes it feels like, \"Oh Allah, give me a lot of money.\" But then it's fine; I'm getting the service. It can be charged. But at this moment, I can't really speak from my perspective about whether people will be happy with a monthly charge or unhappy with a one-time charge. The subscription thing, what I personally look at... I generally prefer annual fees for clubs or places where I've studied and have affiliations. I pay the money once, and I know. For example, I am a member of Bogura Golf Club. It charges monthly. But I always pay the full 12,000 Taka in January for the whole year. I can't remember to pay every month. And if it's possible to pay a one-time membership fee somewhere, I would prefer that. That's obviously what I'm saying. Since it might be a bit of a large amount. But personally, if it automatically deducts monthly, then it's fine. But if I have to manually pay it, I might forget and not feel comfortable.\nMuhammad: I understand, Bhai. Okay, Jishan Bhai, these are my main points, Insha'Allah. Let me share one more thing I forgot to mention regarding training. We are planning to bring the training here, but we are planning it a bit differently. For this, we are making very short videos, say 10 to 15-minute learning videos. And then these videos will have modules, and after the videos, there will be quizzes like Duolingo.\nMuhammad: So that learning actually becomes fun. For example, when we used to train for Hajj, we would go in the morning, then afternoon, and it would become evening. After half an hour, nothing would go into our heads.\nJishan: At one point, it would become very... clogged.\nMuhammad: Yes, so that doesn't happen, and pilgrims can watch the modules on demand. Very small modules. If you forget anything there, watching those modules will help you. And for this, there will be some quizzing. We are also planning to bring this. What is your opinion on this? Do you think this is a good option, or are the long videos and courses we watch now better options?\nJishan: Short videos are obviously better. Because that connection remains, it stays in your mind, and you can watch it when needed. With long videos or long training, what happens is, I won't remember that question, where I left it. If it's divided into small, small parts, it becomes easier, I think, in terms of learning. Then again, it's also true that in many cases, this might be more true for Umrah, because Umrah involves very short preparation, Hajj involves long preparation. Those who go for Hajj, at least they go with a certain level of preparation. For Umrah, I feel that when agencies provide these training sessions, if they force it, people don't pay much attention. Otherwise, many times people don't even come, they have office work, etc., and they have to rush. Since the connection is less, they are going for a maximum of 10-12 days.\nJishan: Hajj, I know, Bhai, Hajj is a commitment. The commitment of Hajj is much greater than that of Umrah by default. I mean, if Hajj is 100%, Umrah is not more than, I think, 20% or 25% of internal commitment. Short videos will definitely be more useful, I would say. But how to roll it out is a different discussion. My short video, personally, those topic-specific, small ones... I'll give a small example. If I'm inside praying, and I need to go to the washroom, okay? So, which place can I go to the washroom? Just an example. Or, as I said, I finished that pick-up or the CG, which one I do after which. If it's small, small parts, if it's a whole big thing, then sometimes I feel things get lost, I don't remember them outside. When we went for Hajj, after Hajj, the obligatory Umrah we had to perform after arriving in Makkah, that night we did it. When I lost sight of our Sheikh who was with us, I felt very lost. I knew everything. Oh Allah, what will I do now? I'm lost, it's not working. So, if I had something at hand then, I would have seen, \"Okay, I have it with me.\" He's gone, okay. He sat down earlier. But I have it with me. Small videos are necessary because sometimes it won't be that I read everything beforehand and then go for Umrah. I might have to look at it on the spot. So, that's why the video needs to be short. That's my view.\nMuhammad: Exactly, small tips.\nMuhammad: Exactly. I mean, will it take 10-15 minutes like this? But it's like a speech-type thing, like a reel, a three to five-minute video that you can watch. How to perform Tawaf, how to perform Sa'i? Okay, what is the dua for this? Okay? These kinds of things. Plus, some special duas, the duas are mentioned like this. Anything else, Jishan Bhai, thank you very much. You have given some very good insights. I pray that Allah grants you, me, and everyone who went for Hajj together in 2022, the acceptance of Hajj (Mabroor Hajj), and grants them the opportunity to go there again.\nJishan: Insha'Allah, we will go together. I hope we can go together.\nMuhammad: Thank you, Bhai. Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh. Okay, talk to you Insha'Allah. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalam."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: Hello.\nMoe Fallatah: Can you hear me, brother?\nMuhammad: Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?\nMoe Fallatah: Alhamdulillah, brother. Good to hear from you. Good to hear from you.\nMuhammad: Thank you. Always uh happy to be here.\nMuhammad: Uh thank you very much brother for your time. Uh so brother inshallah I'll start by introducing myself. Um my name is uh Muhammad uh Rahan Muheim. Um I used to live in Canada. I did my undergraduate and masters from uh Ontario and Vancouver, Canada. And after afterwards I right now I moved to Bangladesh to stay with my parents and recently I'm working with a Malaysian venture capital u like studio uh uh firm. So the I'm doing like a short research with them focusing on identifying uh challenge like various uh stakeholder field in the Hajj and Umrah sector. So that's basically core of the meeting. So I have seen alhamdulillah you are working as a senior business uh specialist in the uh group. So I think this is uh a very good opportunity for me alhamdulillah to talk with you and get insight from you to understand um how uh like a reputed hotel chain like operates um what are some of the challenge that you face and how you think uh technology can make it better for everyone basically that's the purpose in also also for the sake of research brother if it is okay if I record this meeting uh then that would be very helpful inshallah can I do that?\nMoe Fallatah: Okay, it's fine. Okay. Inshallah brother. So inshallah brother why don't we um I already know alhamdulillah your brother Muhammad fa um falat and alhamdulillah you work as in love group. Uh would you like to share a bit more about yourself or do you think that's enough?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh no it's fine no problem. My name is Muhammad Fata. Uh have graduated from New York University in the major of computer engineering technology. I started my war career in uh 2018. It's been now almost seven years. Uh as you know that I'm working with love group as a senior business application. Uh it's mostly it's application related that application to enhance the business and enhance the operation for the for the for internally.\nMuhammad: I see. I see. Mah that's It's really good. Alhamdulillah. So brother can you maybe share a bit like how um like group AOR group or any other big hotel chain or or medium level hotel chain operate in Saudi Arabia because in Saudi Arabia there are it's not like other part where like they directly share their hotel through a GDS platform. There are nusukis available there is makam which is like government portal is available also people like to buy uh like hotel and everything directly from them. So what is the scenario like how it actually operates?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh actually we are about uh we have two business line. First business line which is travel that is related to booking and make the reservations and buying tickets for our customers. And the other part which is hospitality we have about 10 uh or nine hotels uh around uh all over Saudi Arabia between Mecca and Medina and Riyad. Uh we have four hotels in Mecca and we have another three or four hotels also in Medina and Jeda as well. We do have also two hotels in Jedda. So our business is has two different parts as I told you which is hospitality and travel. uh and the travel agency. The travel agency is always the mostly uh is uh uh operation is mostly with uh making booking for our customers and uh uh buying tickets as well. We have uh contracts with some agencies. Uh this is about the travel and about the hospitality that we are uh uh have guests from all over the world that comes to our uh hotels and stay and spend their joyful time with us.\nMuhammad: Mah that's very good. So in both hospitality and travel business what are some of the major challenges that you feel?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh I believe it in this kind of business the most important is how to trans your customer, how to make them back to you, how to make them your uh your like your best place to stay or your best uh place of service. So these are the challenges uh challenges that we are facing uh here in our business for us as a corporate office that we are supporting these uh hotels and make sure they are uh they are having the best type of business which is uh in my in my field that is re that is re relevant to applications business wise and in travel also we do have some applications that also reent our business uh business uh business line and we support this type of uh of business I see.\nMuhammad: So brother in terms of customer satisfiability so what are some of the challenge you face like how like is it related to um ensuring c like the customer is uh given like the service they are promised is it more related to staff management or is it more related to uh like selling through the right channel?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh it has many it has many different effects in if it is something that related to our customers and also as well for the employees that are in our company. Uh like what are the how how much the skills they have, how much knowledge they know about the business and how much they can attract the customers to be our usual customers. Like I like he comes to us every time and he enjoy his time and stay with us or also he like he always choose enough services with uh that is for booking or preparing their tickets or preparing their any reservations that matters.\nMuhammad: I see. So brother in terms of booking um I alhamdulillah I myself stayed at Ilafinda Hotel in Makkah. The service was very good. Alhamdulillah and there was also like the survey that was given But the way I booked this ticket using a third party portal like booking.com or aoda and I have seen uh like this um rooms they are sold on various tech channel like sometimes people directly go to the hotel uh room they buy this room and sometimes they um went they sell using uh travel travel portal and also sometimes they are being sold uh using directly from channel. So what are the variation of distribution uh channel overall in uh for Hajj and Umra uh hotels and uh how you ensure that the customer is getting like a better price uh for the hotel?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh for the pricing and these things we have uh departments that it fully and focused on the reservations and the surfaces. So these these departments are focusing on uh on the price and for focusing on the services as much as you are giving a good services and you are giving uh a price that is uh come uh come uh come uh competitive with other other uh other uh like other other companies that they are they are in in the business with us they will be happy with that.\nMuhammad: I see I see what you're saying. Now like from the research that we are conducting one of the things we have find like the the way this hotel are distributed they gone through like a layer of uh agents. So first maybe like the like the core hotel they sell it to one party that party sell it to another party and the third may sell it to customer. So due to this uh layered uh network sometimes when the customer actual customer who is doing hajan umra they receive the hotel they can sometimes pay up to 50% more than what the hotel is actually uh receiving. So for example if a hotel love group selling a hotel room for $100 like customer they ended up paying maybe $150 and this big am amount of money that this $50 um pricing is going to a third party or middleman that is becoming uh have like two challenge. One it is making hotel room more expensive for customer and also like enough is getting a lower price than what customer is actually paying. So what are the steps and strategies do you think uh people can take to mitigate this big pricing gap or Is it possible for end user who are directly coming from Hajan Umrah directly buy from Ilaf in a much cheaper rate?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh for us to overcome this this type of differences and this type of challenges that we are always focusing on our uh on our prices on our prices and our contracts with these agencies to try try to make it match with our internal uh reservation office. So most of our customers are getting directly to us through phone or through email or uh uh through the elab website. We have the marketing team as well as they are working on that. So this is the only way I believe that we are uh we are uh we are handling this type of issues.\nMuhammad: I see. I see. And for agency how agencies are getting hotel from you. So for example, there are two\nMoe Fallatah: uh we do have uh can you continue please? Sorry.\nMuhammad: Yeah. So there are two type of agencies that one is more like smaller agencies like for example they like they organize group travel. So for example Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan all of these places there are people they bring a big amount of group towards uh this hotel. On the on the other hand uh there is also um um what is this thing called uh like website like booking.com and uh like agoda they sell this hotel so how this different channel different party get the hotel from you?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh I believe it's through the venue and the the res uh reservations uh department who are uh who are very very strict about the prices processing. Even with these agencies, we have contracts. We are we are we have a limit of uh we have a limit of uh limit of prices that it's uh not not touchable. We are able to gain a revenue from being an agency contracting with us but we cannot like uh go beyond uh and above of our uh standards our standard price.\nMuhammad: I see I see that makes perfect sense. So brother I think some of the research that um questions I have that is more focused on with the distribution channel uh distribution channel then like how they are being uh distributed and so in that regard do you think it would be possible for you to connect me with someone uh in the reservation side who can help me on that aspect of the research?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh honestly I cannot promise you but I'll try my best to to get it uh done for you. Just give me a few days to contact them and see how to uh like how to manage this.\nMuhammad: Okay but inshallah that would be really really helpful. And lastly for customer satisfaction. So for example if I come to hotel through agodora.com or booking.com or or like a travel agency. How you make sure that next time if I come to Makka or Modina I also stayed in aaf hotel like what are some of the channel you use? How you make sure a customer who come to hotel he doesn't lose the leads or offer that is available is there any channel right now?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh I believe by covering every need that customer would need with uh in the trans transportations, in the food and beverages, even the room, giving them off better offers and discount. Uh make them happy as much as we can in with the hard welcoming, being kind. All of these uh all of these things will give a good affection on any customer.\nMuhammad: Yes, inshallah. And last topic brother I have is business expansion and scalability. Lots of the people right now is want to come uh to do Haj and Umra comfortably and they want like better service uh with a fair price and I think a company like can make a huge contribution in here. So uh howaf is strategizing like making their presence known in not America then Europe and then countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia. So people in those countries they know about um enough hotel they can directly book with them and they can get like a better service. So they focus more on their worship and this logistics have been taken by your hospitality team. So how you doing this business outreach and business scaling and what are the challenge you are facing regarding this?\nMoe Fallatah: uh in this kind of businesses? I believe it's The biggest challenge is how to keep your your your reput reputation high. You have a high volume. There is many uh organizations that provide hospitality and provide travel services but it's the most difficult is how to keep your reputation uh always high. How to keep your customers uh always happy uh like customers is it's uh the customers demand it's very easy to know and get and as much as you coverage this this demand uh they will be happy and they they return to you uh marketing team are doing incredible job to uh to make us and to keep our repetition in always in a high in a high lines. Uh they uh even with the survey that and feedbacks from customers and what they're missing what they're missing during their stay and what during their needs. So it will be uh it will be in the next time it will be provided. We are always aiming to enhance our business, enhance the services and make our customers happy. I see.\nMuhammad: So for example, reputable travel agencies or online portal uh like in Muslim countries if they if they want to support the Muslim community uh by sending them to hotel, how can they create a partnership uh with companies like ILAF?\nMoe Fallatah: Uh this is mostly related to the business development department. They have their uh Now we are in we are in business for almost more than 30 35 years with the enhancement with the development we have we are we are opening new hotels we are renewing some of our old hotels and uh by getting communicating uh and communicate with these agencies in uh like aboard it it it always will help us I believe and they are always open for for new people, for new agencies, they are welcoming uh they are even if you sit a new meeting, even if you sit a new meeting with the VP of the business development, he will be always uh open to have these meetings and open talks and tell uh tell them about and what is it.\nMuhammad: Okay brother, so I think brother it would be really helpful inshallah if you can connect me with someone from business development as well and also there is a ervation process as well. So I can gather this information and share it with other people. So inshallah people will know the good work Ilaf group is doing and also it will help expand um's uh business and also people from various parts of the world they can directly reserve uh with group inshallah. So brother it would be really helpful if you can connect me with some executive from these two department inshallah so I can interview them as well.\nMoe Fallatah: Okay. Fantastic. Fantastic. Clear.\nMuhammad: Okay brother inshallah. So that's all for me. Inshallah. So I will share like a short summary of what we discuss uh with you in your LinkedIn and inshallah if you can uh provide me contact of your business development and research team. I think that would be very helpful. Inshallah.\nMoe Fallatah: Inshallah.\nMuhammad: Okay for your time. May Allah reward you in this inshallah.\nMoe Fallatah: Thank you. Thank you. for your prayers and hope to meet you again."

Can you hear me?\n[00:02] Muhammad: Mohamad, I can hear you.\n[00:03] Muhammad: Okay. So, I think we'll wait for a bit for brother Musa.\n[00:06] Muhammad: Hopefully, he will join. I'll he send him a message inshallah.\n[00:09] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: [best guess: As-salamu alaykum]. Sorry for the delay on my hand.\n[00:15] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Muhammad, how are you?\n[00:16] Muhammad: Welcome.\n[00:17] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: How are you guys doing?\n[00:18] Muhammad: Alhamdulillah. So, I'll do a quick introduction.\n[00:20] Muhammad: Brother Musa, you know me very well. Alhamdulillah. We have worked in neighboring uh I think office in community tech. I'd like to introduce you with uh Sister. So I got introduced to her through like the incub like a venture studio program of Hassan VC run by brother Omar Munshi. I think you know brother Omar Munshi right?\n[00:33] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Uh yes.\n[00:34] Muhammad: Yes. So he started this venture studio program which both of I were part of. So we are trying to create something that will um help a new founder uh like solve some of the challenge and act as an AI co-founder and Brother N, this is Brother Musa, he is the founder of Tartil AI. It's alhamdulillah one of the best uh Quran memorization app. Alhamdulillah, he almost bootstrapped it, started as his personal project, and alhamdulillah, right now it's helping millions of persons worldwide. So Uh, Muhammad, your uh your audio has uh been cut off for me.\n[00:54] Muhammad: Mohammed, I think um your audio is not clear. Um I couldn't like hear you for the whole of your of your sentences just now.\n[01:01] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: So, Sister Nur, what country are you based out of?\n[01:04] Muhammad: Um yeah, right now I'm in base uh I'm based in Malaysia.\n[01:07] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Okay, nice.\n[01:08] Muhammad: Yeah. Uh and uh yeah, I've joined this venture studio program. Um but uh I actually got to know um brother Muhammad Akar from um because he's from Singapore and I live in [best guess: Johor Bahru]. [best guess: Johor Bahru] is actually just like...\n[01:17] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I, I know it. Yeah, I lived in Singapore at one point actually.\n[01:21] Muhammad: Oh, you live in Singapore? I see.\n[01:22] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: No, not Yeah. Not not right now, but uh I, I lived there in uh 2018 for 4 months.\n[01:28] Muhammad: I see. So So you kind of know like Johor is like just a a neighbor of Singapore. So...\n[01:32] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah, I took the bus from uh I took the bus from Singapore to [best guess: Kuala Lumpur] one time, for example. So of course we, we passed through uh through Johor Bahru and uh and like, I, you know, I got a little familiar with the geography. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah, you know, quite well.\n[01:43] Muhammad: Mohammed, my connection is good. Sorry. I think I was trying to introduce you with brother Musa. So brother Musa and I used to work in the same compound uh in Waterloo. So through that I know him. And brother Musa, I worked with Sister N from [best guess: Hasan VC] Venture Studio and we are trying to build what would be an ideal AI co-founder would be for newly new entrepreneur that would help them some of their main challenge of founding a startup. So this was like originally Sister N's idea. I am helping him as a technical person. So inshallah, I would like to get some insight from you. So Sister N, it's up to you inshallah if you can start the conversation.\n[02:10] Muhammad: Sure. Um okay, let me start uh by uh perhaps um asking you to um if you could like introduce yourself and um tell a little bit about your startup journey. How do you started back then from ground zero to something that you have today?\n[02:26] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Sure. So um, uh I uh lived in Waterloo and studied at the University of Waterloo. Uh during that time, I was working on a lot of side projects to uh improve my own skill set. Uh and I started work on this uh tool called Ekkra at the time, which later turned into Tartil. And that tool was solving my own problem of being able to search the Quran using your voice. Uh so instead of needing to type, because I, I struggled with like Arabic typing and Arabic keyboard and stuff like this. Um I was like, I should just be able to, you know, uh recite like a word or a few words or something from an ayat that I remember and find it or find all the matches for it and whatnot. So I built that for myself. Uh I ended up kind of evangelizing that work. Uh people were really excited about it and wanted it to then, since it knew what you were reciting, it wanted it to correct your recitation. But the main bottleneck at that point was the accuracy of the speech-to-text technology, and uh the bottleneck was needing our own model that uh would have uh high enough accuracy to actually do correction. So I met a number of different brothers. Uh we all worked on this in different capacities, like an open-source volunteer project, etcetera. And uh the progress was really slow in that capacity. So, um in 2020, uh we made the decision basically to uh uh to like uh some of us, uh like four of us, decide to like work on this as an actual company. So we had the appropriate time and resources allocated to actually see it grow. Uh two of us, including uh myself, uh quit our jobs uh and then started working on it full-time, uh basically from the end of 2020. Uh and then uh the other two uh did the same. Uh so that's kind of uh where we got started. Uh we raised initial seed round from Muslim angel investors, and then we uh grew the company after that bootstrapped. Uh so that's kind of the very quick summary of uh my journey with Tartil.\n[04:22] Muhammad: All right. Uh thank you for sharing. Um it was great. Uh perhaps you could tell, during your journey, uh um um since you have raised initial seed round from angel investors, like what are the biggest challenges you face as a founder in the early stages of your startup?\n[04:41] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, the biggest challenge you face in the early stage of your startup is not necessarily investment. Investment is something you don't necessarily need, depending on what you're building.\n[04:48] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: The biggest challenge you have is actually proving product-market fit.\n[04:52] Muhammad: All right. So can you explain a little bit in terms of the um when you try to prove the product-market fit?\n[04:57] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah. So in our case, uh we had very strong signal that there's product-market fit, and our challenge was actually building out the product to match it. Uh and still, until today, that's one of the, we clearly have product-market fit, but there's still some challenges around that, in the sense that um, uh we had many, many people telling us, \"We, we want to be able to recite and it correct our mistakes, and this is something we would pay for.\" Uh so that was like the kind of clear indication that there would be product-market fit if we actually built this. Uh and we had signal that people already paid for uh teachers to listen to their recitation and correct their recitation and things like that. So we had that signal there in terms of the fit. But for us, the challenge was, because it's a very technical product, actually building the technology uh to meet that product-market fit and getting it to a level of fidelity where people are actually comfortable using it and paying for it. So that was like one of the main challenges on our end. But usually, the the the thing is normally you have a hypothesis for something, like you have some understanding that okay, I think this is a problem and I think that if I do this solution, it will solve this problem. You need to actually prove that. Like you need to actually prove that your understanding the problem is correct, and that if you build this solution and it works properly, then people will actually pay for it.\n[06:21] Muhammad: So in the case that you've given me here of, \"Okay, I want to build something that helps people like found a company as like a kind of like some kind of uh technology-based co-founder,\" um you need to prove that that's the piece that people are actually struggling with in terms of founding a company and you need to prove that your solution would actually help them get past that point and then you need to prove what would they pay for that. Like, um based on um your product and market fit, right? Uh were there like um early signals from the user or the market that you wish you had taken more seriously?\n[06:58] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Um I think in the beginning we built a bunch of stuff that didn't really matter. Like we had some theories about gamification. We kind of did a half-baked attempt to ship that stuff before Ramadan. So that still like lives in the product till today, but it's not very valuable functionality and maybe it wasn't the right area to focus on. Uh so I think that's one of the main lessons I would uh learn from it is that uh uh really focus on just doing one thing very, very well before you build out all this other like fluff, basically, around it that just kind of uh supports it but doesn't really matter. Like nobody is really paying for Tartil for the badges or for the leaderboards or something like this. They're really paying for Tartil for the for their recitation features at this point, primarily. So, uh like that's the main thing. Like if we improve the accuracy of our mistake detection or we build additional experiences around the mistake detection and things like this,\n[08:14] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Uh testing experiences or things like this, that's the main area where people actually pay for it. Uh and that's what proves product-market fit.\n[08:24] Muhammad: In our operation, do you use any AI tools in your startup?\n[08:27] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Sorry, I think your audio has a problem. It's like very muffled for me now.\n[08:31] Muhammad: Yeah, N, I think last thing you said is a bit muffled. Can you maybe bring it closer to the mic?\n[08:35] Muhammad: Okay. Can you hear me now?\n[08:37] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: It's still a bit muffled. It was very clear earlier, but now a bit muffled.\n[08:40] Muhammad: Okay. Okay. I was asking like, in, in your operation, um of your internal, internal process, right, do you use any AI tools in your startup? And if yes, what purpose for that, uh the tools?\n[08:55] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Uh yeah, we use AI for a bunch of stuff. Like engineers use it for coding. Uh we use it for translation, uh like of UI strings and things like this. Uh we use it for brainstorming. Uh we use it for um, like we're integrating it currently within our customer support flows. Uh, so we're using it across a number of different areas.\n[09:12] Muhammad: You can tell the tool that you're using for coding. Can you name it?\n[09:16] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Sorry, the audio still isn't that clear from uh my end.\n[09:20] Muhammad: Oh, okay. Muhammad, can you like take over for us and I will, I'll try to fix this.\n[09:25] Muhammad: Okay. So, for example, uh, brother Musa, so if you are talking about the AI tool that you use, what are some of the main uh AI tools, if you name them, that you use uh right now for your product? So if you give me maybe three top AI tools that you cannot live without.\n[09:50] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, like engineers are using Cursor primarily. Uh a lot of team members are using ChatGPT, uh and um, and for AI and things like this, there's a lot of different customer support tools with AI that have come up in the last uh year or six months. So we're still experimenting with those to see what we adopt, but that should make a big difference, and we've already tested some of them. Like Intercom has their own offering, for example, called Fin. Uh there's ParaHelp, there's Chatbase, there's a whole bunch of different ones.\n[10:17] Muhammad: So, as you've seen, like uh, as I said earlier, like one of the main challenges for you is to find out, is like the product-market fit, to understand like whether your customer actually like your product, and you had, you said you had some signal, um so...\n[10:30] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: It's not about they'll, they like the product. Just to interrupt you there. Like, it's quite important you understand this piece. Product-market fit isn't whether they like the product. It's whether they'll actually like, like, like use the product in the way that you're intending, like whether they'll pay for it. For example, if you're trying to sell a product and they like it, but you need to sell it at $100 and they're only willing to pay 10, then there's no product-market fit. It doesn't matter that they, in theory, they like it.\n[10:57] Muhammad: I see what you're saying. So if this product-market fit you want to test it right now, would you do it like same way you do it um back in your Waterloo days or you would have done it differently using AI? And if you differently now, how would you do it now?\n[11:13] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Uh yeah, you don't really, like AI is a tool like within different capacities to achieve certain objectives. It's not what builds your product. So I would, like, I would still, if I'm writing code, I would still go back and use Cursor. If Cursor was available five years ago, sure, I'll use Cursor five years ago or 10 years ago or whenever. Like these, these tools aren't building the, like, are supporting me in doing certain tasks. They're not the the basis of the product itself. They're not building the product.\n[11:42] Muhammad: I see what you're saying. But uh for understanding uh users' vibe, understanding whether your users actually want to use the product or not, right? For understanding those things, uh would you use any sorts of AI tool? Or say, for example, analyzing how your user responded to something, what sorts of AI tool would you think might be helpful?\n[12:00] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, if there's some AI to summarize signals from, if you're able to like uh screen record people's uh sessions on your website or these kind of things like session replays and analyze that stuff, maybe that could be useful to you. But at the end of the day, you need to figure out what are the key metrics that prove that people are actually using your service and sticking around with it, and then you just need to track those. I don't know if AI really is needed in that process.\n[12:20] Muhammad: I see. So you think you still want to do it like as you would have done it traditionally? Um that makes sense. So um, excuse me. So uh in terms of um, right now, um, like product management, I think many, many, many times, many of the people, they're suggesting one of the thing that is right now is main bottleneck for tech development is like the product management. So, for example, uh how do you handle like the product management process itself within the organization? Do you use AI or you use like folder systems?\n[12:53] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, we just use like uh, like we write up like product specifications and and uh we do user research sessions and and and like these kind of traditional processes. Are we using AI as parts of these things? Sure. So we'll be like using AI to like research certain topics. Like we use ChatGPT to actually look into certain topics and brainstorm like different ways of approaching certain problems or things like this. Uh we'll use, for example, like AI note-takers in our research sessions or things like this to allow the researcher to focus more on the questions they're asking. Like the AI is being used as a tool within these processes, but the processes themselves haven't changed.\n[13:46] Muhammad: Um, one of the things you guys have done, especially with Tartil, you like the problems solved, which is like training, training a machine learning model to like understand like the recitation and understand if it is like uh doing it uh correctly from Arabic pronunciation. That was like a very novel problem even back, uh especially back then when the Arabic language model and TTS was not that developed. So how do you guys uh like focus on that and how AI changed your entire research-oriented development focus?\n[14:02] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, that process has nothing to do with AI. Like, we're like, aside from the fact that we're producing AI, like training it itself is gathering like data and labeling the data and training the models. So there's no like, there's minimal AI in the AI training process. The AI is the outcome.\n[14:18] Muhammad: When it comes to doing like very novel research. Do you think AI help you to understand like the latest paper and latest technology and able to implement the paper itself or like help you uh do more like research-focused engineering work?\n[14:30] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah. But this isn't related to like something being novel or not in that regard. Like in any domain, if you're looking to understand some new topic, like AI is just a helpful tool for summarizing, uh for finding appropriate context on the internet. Um like, like there's certain things that it's used for regardless of it's novel research or not. Like if you're trying to learn how to cook something new. You know, you've got a new biryani recipe or you've never made biryani and you, you want to know what are all the different kinds of biryani and how they vary depending on the country and like what are the core ingredients and what are some popular recipes for biryani and all this stuff, like you can use ChatGPT for this. And in the same way, if you're trying to figure out like, okay, what is MCP and like how do I integrate MCP in my products and what is the way of thinking about this and stuff, if you ask the appropriate questions, you can get the, you know, like helpful like learnings and insights from it. So it's, it's like a, it's not specific to novel research or anything like that.\n[15:53] Muhammad: I see. Um so one of the, you actually work in a faith-based tech. Like there is a common misconception, or maybe this is true, uh but especially Muslim community, they don't like to spend money when it comes to faith-based product. Rather, they want, they have a notion that, \"Okay, Islamic product should be free.\" So what was your go-to-market strategy for that? And do you feel like Muslim community indeed hold this kind of mentality toward Islamic products?\n[16:19] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, the community holds the mentality. I think our company specifically has actually shifted that mentality for some people. We know many of our subscribers are subscribing to Tartil as their first in-app subscription, let alone their first Islamic subscription. Um so definitely like we ourselves have actually led to a shift in terms of that mentality. Uh but um the mentality still holds to a large degree. I see people all the time in social media questioning like subscription costs for this and stuff like that. But the the main thing is you should also like be able to understand like what the key value proposition is uh of like what you've built and and how it compares to something else that people are already paying for. So we don't replace an Imam or a Sheikh or whoever you're like going to recite to, but that person potentially you're already paying them in many contexts. And uh and even whether you are or you aren't, like Tartil is like serving a role, like, you know, you're meeting with them an hour a week, the rest of like the, you know, like uh like 24/7 outside of that hour, Tartil is available for you. So I think it's understanding the positioning and actually having like a a key unique improvement that you're offering. And what we did is we offered a freemium model. So to get people in the door, we offered the the free tier and people can try it and things like that and then we offer free trials. Uh and from there we work on conversion. So uh that's been our approach.\n[17:49] Muhammad: I see. I understand. So um, in that case, one thing you earlier said, it's really important for you to focus. But when it comes to Quran recitation, there is 10 right that people recite. And like, for example, somebody who is from um, Nigeria, the way he would recite versus somebody who is from Pakistan, the recitation would be slightly different. So how you manage this focus in terms of correct recitation? So do you uh like target only few um recitation style or that work on all recitation style and how to manage priorities?\n[18:23] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: So the style isn't so much of an issue if they're actually reciting correctly. What you want to do is you want to train your model using data from different sources. Should all look the exact same. So you feed in audio from Pakistan, you feed in audio from Nigeria, etcetera. You'll get a model that can deal with the two of them. Uh but there's areas where we don't focus, which is actually like, for example, so we don't support, we don't support [best guess: Qira'at], we don't support anything other than Hafs right now. Eventually, we would like to, when we have the appropriate resources for it. But right now, 90% of the Muslims pretty much are reciting Hafs, uh and especially in many of the countries where people are actually paying for these types of things, they are reciting Hafs. So that's a big enough market to tackle it, to solve for it, to to build a good experience around it. Uh and then inshallah, we can get to the point of supporting other.\n[19:30] Muhammad: Can you hear me now?\n[19:31] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah, I can hear you. But I think, but I think you got it cut off. Uh so yeah. So anyway, I understand your point. Um, now uh in terms of uh data collection and data privacy, right? So to train a model like this uh properly, like you need a huge volume of data. So as a new startup, what was your strategy to uh as a data-driven startup to collect data so that people trust with you that their data is going to be stored securely and uh nothing is bad is going to happen? So how was your challenge to win the trust and collect the data?\n[20:11] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, I think this is a matter of brand to some degree. Like you have to build the appropriate brand around what you're doing so that people have the perception that you will, that you will, uh uh be trustworthy, and then you have to honor that, you have to actually be trustworthy. So it's not like a straightforward thing. Like there's people until today who they still have concerns about their data privacy and data storage and stuff like this, even though we're, you know, like we're an established company to some degree and um, uh and, you know, we're serving millions of people. But the uh like still there's people who have those concerns. So I don't think there's a, it's a zero or one. It's a, \"I need a certain amount of data. I need to convince certain quantity of people or I need to find a certain number of sources that are willing to give me that data uh in a way that I can use it basically and establish that trust.\" That looks different in different domains. And also most AI products right now are not being like fine-tuned on massive amounts of data in an entirely new context, like what we did with Tartil. Like the majority of AI products right now are just wrappers around ChatGPT or things like this. They're really integrating AI within a product experience. So the vast majority of people don't really have this issue in the first place in terms of building up this data set and stuff like this. This is more unique towards uh the specific problem we tackle.\n[21:28] Muhammad: Yeah. Uh it's, so I have uh one question regarding that. So I understand that you are using your own proprietary model, but you also say you are kind of bootstrapped. So hosting your own proprietary model, like training like an existing model, it is uh kind of very expensive, um if you have to host it in a way. So how do you uh how challenging was it to manage your server cost, especially when it comes to uh buying GPU and model uh those sorts of things?\n[21:58] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: So hosting it for inference, which is actual production use, is not that big of a deal. We managed to figure out over time how to get that cost down. You know, originally it was more expensive than it even is now, because uh like even with a much smaller amount of users, because we hadn't figured out how to optimize some of the things to make the right tradeoffs. So as we had those learnings, those costs went down. Uh but they were, they were substantial costs, and there even now, they're still substantial costs, but it's not anything crazy. The bigger costs actually usually training. How do you like get all the data, manage all the data, train models with this data, etcetera? And the GPU is required for that. That becomes more of a cost. And that's also a challenge. Like early on, we spent some money on GPUs, but we also, uh we also got support from certain key like individuals with access to like compute clusters. Uh so we, we had access. Like Stability AI had a compute cluster, like a super cluster, and uh and we were able to actually get free access to that for a period of time in a limited capacity, but we still, that was quite helpful. Um like uh the, there's some of these things alhamdulillah like came and and unblocked us on some of these things. Right now, we have money that we spend on compute, like it's part of our operating costs.\n[23:25] Muhammad: I see. Now the question comes to AI in terms of religious space, right? So like, like certain things like health, religious, they're very sensitive. So how would you handle like the cost of the mistake? So if I give an example, if I read and memorize Quran through Tartil and I made a mistake, but Tartil is not able to catch that, I continuously reading that mistake and that mistake become ingrained for me. That's kind of become like a challenge for any AI that deals with this sorts of area. So how do you handle the social responsibility of notifying users and um making sure like they're not learning something uh negative uh in terms of uh like using an AI-based tool?\n[24:19] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah, the important thing here is the positioning. So I would say like um uh like with Tartil for example, we don't position Tartil as being 100% accurate. You'll never hear us say that. It's not true in the first place. Uh so this is the thing, like you're not supposed to expect that Tartil will never make any mistake or something like that. We don't position it like that. We even explicitly say we don't do tajwid at all. Um that, that's the first thing. The second thing is like the way we position it is as a supplement. So, so you should still, like if you have the ability to work with a teacher, we don't tell you, \"Stop working with the teacher.\" And you start, you also never hear us say that you should continue working with the teacher, like whether it's a [best guess: Qari] or whoever uh is qualified to actually listen to your recitation and correct mistakes and things like this. You should still be working with those types of individuals. But Tartil is a supplement outside of that time that's allowing you to actually catch a percentage of your mistakes that weren't being caught before. So Tartil is positioned as an incremental value add. Previously, you were reciting on your own and nobody was there to listen to you and 0% of your mistakes were caught. Now you're reciting to, let's say it catches 80% or 90% or whatever percentage, even if it was 20%. The point is that 20% is instead of zero. So the thing is you're not using it to replace a process that's at 100% and then you're accountable for the mistakes. Like you're not using it to replace the teacher. You're using it as an additional supplement to substitute for the 0% situation. So that's the main thing. But I see a lot of people trying to do AI Islamic stuff where they want to answer like give like [best guess: fatawa] and and answer like religious questions and stuff like that. Definitely most of those people are going to be held accountable for doing that without the appropriate uh appropriate like uh like uh guidelines and and uh and guardrails and and whatever.\n[26:39] Muhammad: I see. Makes sense. So I have my last question to you, then I'll pass it to Sister Nur for conclusion. Like, changing people's mindset. So even back in early 2018, 2019, if somebody tell like this idea that learning Quran or giving uh like reading to a mobile app, that would sound absurd. But right now, alhamdulillah, Tartil is doing very well. There is [best guess: an] Indonesia-based [app] that is doing well. Uh so alhamdulillah this space is developing and you people work a very good job changing people's mindset to trusting a mobile app to do this uh thing. So what was that journey and how is, what is the challenge you face and how you overcome it?\n[27:26] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I mean, I think the main thing is like you have to actually build something that works, and then it's, it's a slow, it's a slow challenge. Like many people when they download, they're skeptical of whether it's going to work. I think one of the things that helped us is we actually got in like, there's a period of AI, I think now people are trusting AI again more generally. There was a period where people didn't really trust it. They were pointing out all the mistakes and all the the significant problems with AI, and we, we came before, before all of that. Like we started in a place where AI wasn't really a thing in the first place. So people were very skeptical. If they try it, they have a bad experience, then that skepticism grows. If they try it and they have a good experience, then like, then they're willing to to use it. So I think the thing is it's not like we all of a sudden changed people's mindsets and now everybody trusts, trusts AI, etcetera. Many people don't. But, you know, we haven't captured everyone in the audience. We've only captured a small fraction of the audience. So some people don't trust [best guess: Tartil]. Fine, they don't trust [best guess: Tartil]. But the point is that's not, that doesn't mean you can't build like something just because there are some people who don't trust it.\n[28:44] Muhammad: I see what you're saying. So these are all the questions I have, brother Musa. So to you, Sister N, to ask any questions. And...\n[28:50] Muhammad: Yeah, I think uh thank you, Mohammed. Um this will be like the last question that we'll be asking. Um so along of your journey uh building Tartil, uh what advice would you give to other um early-stage founders um to be able to like recognize or prevent a similar situation um like you?\n[29:08] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Yeah.\n[29:10] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: I, I think what you need to do is figure out what matters for your solution, uh and figure out how to actually produce it, uh like produce an MVP for that as quickly and early as possible to actually validate what you're doing. So don't think about, \"I'm going to like, if I'm building some AI solution and I'm going to collect data for a year and train and get GPUs and spend $500,000 and whatever,\" and and to just to build something to find out that nobody's going to use it. Like, figure out how to do things. And many other companies have published their own journeys of doing this stuff. Uber is a very famous example of this, for example, where they never built all these algorithms for routing people and stuff originally. You would, like, I think like make their request and and a person was sitting there like matching requests with drivers. Like the person is sitting there manually doing that. That's fine. They prove that at least somebody wants to use this service and then they work on all the scalability and the operations and all this stuff after. But figure out what is the MVP of what you can build to prove in a month or in three months or whatever is necessary in terms of time to actually get that built, like in a relatively quickly, quick period. How do you actually prove that this is uh going to work properly? Um so that, that's the main suggestion I have. Yeah.\n[30:29] Muhammad: I think that's very good.\n[30:31] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Oh, yeah.\n[30:32] Muhammad: Yeah, it's very insightful. Yeah, thank you so much. I think that that will be it. We have come to the end of this interview. Thank you so much uh for spending your time with us and giving insights that will be useful for um this.\n[30:45] Muhammad: Thank you, Musa, for your time. I really appreciate you helping us. Uh so um, you already seem like a [best guess: Hajj] app. I have shared with you. I'm actually helping Nur, I'm continue building the [best guess: Hajj] app, but I pivoted uh more into focusing on B2C [best guess: Hajj] packages a bit and on the I also have been. So let's give you an update. Your insight is always very valuable for me particularly. Uh so thank you again for all the support and inshallah, you know, your journey is is exciting and and full of new challenges and and uh and and learnings for you inshallah.\n[31:21] Mohammad Moussa Tarteel: Okay. Thank you very much, brother.\n[31:23] Muhammad: Thank you so much."

    "english_transcript": "[00:00] Samee: Assalamu Alaikum. This past year, Alhamdulillah, I went to Japan with Shepherds. This year, have you heard of Hasan BC, who is based in Malaysia? Hello? [00:06] Muhammad: Yes, brother, I can hear you. [00:07] Samee: Yes, you've heard of Hasan D.C., right? [00:09] Muhammad: Ah, okay. [00:10] Samee: So Hasan, they are a Malaysia-based venture studio. They mainly finance ethical and Islamic startups, and they also mentor them, kind of like a startup accelerator. So they have a studio program that helps Muslims who want to start businesses before the accelerator. For example, in Bangladesh, you might have heard that Sohag Bhai started something from OnnoRokom Leaders, it's quite similar to that. [00:32] Muhammad: Oh, I see.\n[00:33] Muhammad: So I joined one of their programs. Since I'm interested in Hajj and Umrah, I decided that my part would be to work on the Hajj and Umrah sector. So they have an assignment, which is to interview a mix of groups already working with Hajj and Umrah – be it agencies, pilgrims, hotel providers, or Islamic scholars working as Hajj and Umrah guides. My plan was to interview you as a pilgrim, but now I see, Alhamdulillah, you can help me in multiple ways: as an ex-Hajj pilgrim and also as a new Hajj business entrepreneur. As such, I will ask you some questions for half an hour to get your insights. If you permit, I will keep the meeting recorded, but it will be for internal use for my research, perhaps I will share it with the mentors at Hasan. [01:21] Samee: No problem at all, I'm ready to do anything for you. Thank you, brother. Thank you. [01:25] Muhammad: So Hasan Bhai, Rafi Bhai, shall I begin? Okay, since Rafi Bhai is also here, my first few questions will be based on your past Hajj and Umrah experiences. Then there will be some questions about your new business, and some questions for both of you, for you and Rafi Bhai, on how we can use technology to provide better guidance to pilgrims. Yes. Okay, so let's start with the first questions, Samee Bhai, you performed Hajj twice in 2024 and 2025. Did you perform Umrah?\n[01:53] Samee: I did not specifically go for Umrah; Alhamdulillah, both times I travelled to Saudi Arabia with the intention of Hajj. [01:59] Muhammad: Alhamdulillah. Has Rafi Bhai also performed Hajj or Umrah? He hasn't done it before. Rafi Bhai hasn't performed Hajj or Umrah yet. But Alhamdulillah, Allah has accepted him in such a way that he is going for Hajj along with the management, and he has chosen this for his career journey and life. [02:16] Samee: Alhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah. [02:18] Muhammad: Okay, Samee Bhai, you tell us first, when you performed Hajj twice, from your two Hajj experiences, what were your main challenges as a pilgrim, regarding the logistical aspects like hotels and transport? All of these were handled by Shepherd, but still, even though the whole trip was managed, what were your main challenges? [02:44] Samee: As a pilgrim during Hajj, actually, with how Shepherd worked, there wasn't really much room for challenges, so to speak. However, regarding the management aspect, since I might be a management person, some things related to frequent contact felt a bit noisy to me. What kind of noise? Like constantly communicating on WhatsApp. So I had to keep track of WhatsApp. I felt it was a distraction, which was one of the challenges for me. Other demands actually depended on my mindset, on what my demands were. Other people's demands, for example, might be food, hotel, their comfort. I wasn't that focused on those things. They prepared our mindset in such a way that those things weren't an issue. But I felt that while they provided many services to help us concentrate on Hajj, sometimes it felt noisy. For instance, I had to keep my attention on WhatsApp constantly, waiting for messages. Suddenly a message would pop up saying, \"Pilgrims, there's ice cream here, go check it out.\" I found this unnecessarily very, very less important. Because at the same time, checking so many notifications with everyone. We already suffer from mobile, WhatsApp, or smartphone notifications. And then, having to keep up with so many notifications and updates in one module felt like a problem to me. Rather, this year, when I went for Hajj with a different group, I didn't face such trouble. They had already provided a projection for the next three days right from the start of the day, or rather, they didn't even give daily updates. They gave a projection of what was happening for the next three days every three days. Not sudden, ad-hoc messages. This is very problematic. So for me, this is a very individual feedback. Others might feel that everything is okay, but this is my individual feeling that I need some peace, and checking so many notifications felt noisy. And I think those who managed it this way this year did it right by not giving too many updates. A projection every three days is enough. What would a three-day projection be like? We make business projections for a year or two years. So, if the activities for three days are projected in advance, I think it's better. Some things need to be real-time, like during the main Hajj rituals, when the bus has arrived, everyone should come, it's fine. But these messages should only come when they are absolutely necessary and priority-based, otherwise, it's hard to maintain concentration.\n[04:47] Muhammad: I understand, brother. Brother, let's move to the next question. You stayed in Mecca for a long time, and in Medina for almost a month. During this time, you also travelled around and did sightseeing yourselves, without Shepherd. In this regard, a common problem everyone mentions is that taxi drivers in Mecca and Medina often scam people. They kind of extort money. So what was your experience? Were you satisfied with the transportation you arranged yourselves in Mecca and Medina, apart from Shepherd, or did you feel that something was needed in that sector?\n[05:32] Samee: When travelling without Shepherd, the first problem is language. The second problem is actually what type of people I'm talking to. If my language is okay, since English is not widely used for communication there, and if you don't know Arabic, that's a problem. In that case, it's a bit of an issue. And it seems that those in Medina are much better than those in Mecca, I'm talking about Arabs only. For non-Arabs, among Asians, especially Pakistani drivers, they often charge five or six times more fare, which is simply robbery in plain Bengali. They also commit a lot of injustice and behave rudely, but we haven't seen Arabs do that comparatively. They at least have a certain prestige; they don't commit injustice like Pakistani, Asian, or Indian drivers do with their very rude behaviour. And in Mecca and Medina, what I've seen is that some drivers in Medina, if necessary, sometimes don't even mind if you don't pay the fare; I've encountered such people. So there are good and bad sides. I think among Asian drivers, I would say 85% are unjust. Even if you take an Uber, it's totally safe, but even then, Asian drivers find various excuses. So you have to be very knowledgeable yourself and communicate well with them; that's the kind of experience you get there.\n[07:23] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, brother, let's talk about hotels now. We stayed in the same hotel in Mecca and Medina. It took us 10-15 minutes to reach Haram Sharif from both hotels. Sometimes, people prefer to stay very close, some a bit further, and some prefer to stay very far and use shuttles. So what is your preference? What do you think would give the best experience for pilgrims, balancing money and service? [07:56] Samee: Well, to balance this, I think money is definitely the first factor. Now, if someone has money, they will obviously stay close, brother.\n[08:04] Muhammad: They'll stay at the Intercontinental. Those who have money will definitely not go all the way to Azizia to optimize costs. [08:12] Samee: You understand? Firstly, money definitely matters. Someone's service actually matches their wealth. Some people perform Umrah for 1 lakh 20 thousand Taka, others for 4 lakh Taka. Yes. So I think wealth matters. After that, I think the closer you stay, the better. For example, if I'm in Azizia, I'd struggle to pray every prayer. I'd have to come from there, and I'd need energy. I'd need some rest. I can't maintain concentration for such a long time continuously. So I'd need to drink some coffee or rest for half an hour. I wouldn't need to rest; I'd be exhausted. You understand? In such cases, I'll always try to stay as close as possible according to my means. For example, I want to eat at night after prayer, then quickly get some sleep and leave again around 1:30 or 2:00 AM. I'd stay there, pray, and then come back. So it's easier for me to stay as close as possible. In the future, I will try to stay as close as my wealth allows.\n[09:27] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's talk about hotel services, brother. Both the hotels you stayed in were most likely three-star hotels. But everyone has a concern that they are not happy with the hotel services. What was your perspective on the hotels? [09:47] Samee: Should I talk about 2024 or 2025? [09:49] Muhammad: Talk about both years combined. Overall.\n[09:52] Samee: Okay, in 2024, the hotels we stayed at with Shepherd, I don't know if they could be called three-star. This time, the ones I stayed in were one-star quality, but their service was better than the previous hotels despite the price. [10:11] Samee: Yes, starting from cleanliness to spaciousness and service, here my cost was only 5.5 lakh Taka, and there it was about 7 lakh, nearly 7 lakh Taka, I mean, with other expenses it would be even more. So I think the quality of the hotel this year for 5.5 lakh Taka was far better than what I got last year for 7 lakh Taka.\n[10:35] Samee: Okay, and if you talk about food, there were some changes there. Towards the end, during the main Hajj rituals, a lot of food was provided, a lot was given there. But where I was this time, it was provided consistently. No additional food was given for any special occasion, food was supplied uniformly from beginning to end. [10:59] Muhammad: You mentioned earlier that communication was quite challenging for you at first, but later it was quite good for you. Meaning, that part was more pushy, and later it was more like pulling, they just gave you detailed messages, and then you would communicate if needed. Was WhatsApp the medium of communication? [11:15] Samee: It was WhatsApp. [11:16] Muhammad: I see. Now, brother, let's talk about your exploration. When you went for Hajj and Umrah, you definitely spent some time exploring, shopping, seeing places, and eating out yourselves. How was this exploration for you, and did you feel like you were finding the right places, or did you feel like you didn't recognize the places and needed a guide? [11:42] Samee: Definitely, there should be a guide for those who are completely new. For both new and old pilgrims, having a guide would certainly make things more comfortable and easier. We've seen with Shepherd that they would charge extra for a Ziyarah, for example, 50 or 100 Riyals. They were present, conducting various tours in different places, and the duration was longer. Okay?\n[12:12] Samee: But this time, what we did was free. So for free service, the duration was certainly shorter, and the explanation was less. Shepherd's service was a bit better in that regard, but it also cost more and involved more time. So, having a guide is definitely a good idea, in my opinion. A tourist might think, \"I'll go to Jeddah by the sea, take a look around. I've been here for a long time, so I'll go to Jeddah in the afternoon and return in the evening.\" In such cases, a guide might not be necessary. For example, taking pilgrims to Jeddah for Ziyarah, I think that's a bit different. It's not usually done like that. For showing the city of Jeddah, I don't think a guide is needed. But for other places, suppose you're taking me to Badr, or other historical places. Yes, there, a guide is necessary. Even if there's an Islamic scholar, and they highlight the historical plots and various incidents from the Prophet's biography, I think that's good. [13:14] Muhammad: You saw that the guidance we received, it was given by Sheikh Monjin, who often just sent audio recordings. And in that case, you yourselves went around and explored. Do you think this self-exploration with an audio guide can fill that gap, or is a human guide really necessary sometimes? [13:42] Samee: Sometimes it's not possible. This idea was actually mine, in your management, I think it was last year, I told them that Sheikh couldn't communicate properly or on time in the bus, with everyone together. I told Saleh Bhai, tell the Sheikh to sit in front and send audio recordings, three to four minutes long, okay? Meaning, in real-time, because connectivity was an issue, and using a microphone wouldn't reach everyone, since everyone had WhatsApp. While going on the bus, if he explains, that's good. And I think sending audio recordings is better than joining a Google Meet, because everyone talks at once, and it's hard to keep everyone's attention at the same time. So the audio recording that Sheikh sent at that time, I recommended it. After that, they started this process, and I definitely recommend it. [14:52] Muhammad: Oh, so you're saying that from no guide at all, an audio guide is the next level, and a human guide is perfect.\n[15:02] Samee: Perfect. Yes. [15:04] Muhammad: Okay, I understand. Now, brother, let's talk about Hajj. Hajj is a challenging act of worship. You have performed Hajj twice, and the first time you went alone with friends, and this time you went with an elderly female relative. What challenges do you think pilgrims generally face during Hajj? [15:35] Samee: In this case, brother, to be honest, challenges are really about uncertain arrivals; the permits come very late, and the management is not within our control, you understand? So, such uncertainties, they are a bit challenging – when will what happen? And challenges, specifically, regarding the two managements, last year it was Shepherd. I don't really have any major complaints about it. I didn't face any management challenges because, you know, many elderly people were facing challenges, many had different physical problems, were sick, those were other challenges. So, overall, last year, there were no major challenges in that way. And this year, if I say, I didn't really face challenges that way, from my side, I didn't face any major problems. One challenge that can be mentioned is after reaching Mina, during the last two or three days of throwing stones at the Jamarat, we developed a habit of being taken back to the hotel. This is a challenge, but this time, this challenge was a bit less because I came by train.\n[17:01] Muhammad: Hmm. [17:02] Samee: So, if I were to say, this time too, the challenges were quite few. I can say that I didn't really face any major challenges. [17:11] Muhammad: Alhamdulillah. Okay, hypothetically speaking, Samee Bhai, you are in this business now, but if you weren't, if you were to go for Umrah next time, would you go through an agency or would you go by yourself? What do you think? [17:28] Samee: I would go by myself. I wouldn't go through an agency. I would go alone. [17:34] Muhammad: Okay. [17:35] Samee: Maybe we would go as a group, on our own. [17:38] Muhammad: I understand, I understand. So we've heard about many challenges and perspectives. Now, do you think in which areas, like AI, machine learning, or mobile apps, can make the pilgrims' journey easier, especially for those who are going by themselves without an agency?\n[18:03] Samee: You're asking how AI can help, right? [18:05] Muhammad: AI or mobile app, technology in general. [18:07] Samee: This can actually guide the pilgrim regarding temperature, weather, etc., at that time, which AI will help with. What we already have, what AI can do, you mentioned language, language barrier. [18:20] Muhammad: Yes, it can do that. It can. I've already tried it. I've tried to understand what Google's Samsung Google Interpreter is saying, and what live Uthpa is saying, but it doesn't really work well; it's often incorrect. Another thing is, we all used to carry small printed books, like a guide. In that case, do you think an offline app, one I shared with you, an app I developed, could be an alternative to those guide books?\n[19:02] Samee: Yes, it can definitely be an alternative and can be very useful. Yes, I've used it too, but one thing I've noticed is that if I have something printed in my hand, it feels like the connectivity is better than on a mobile phone. With a mobile, you often feel like taking a picture or doing something else. So, if I want to give my full concentration, having something printed feels a bit better. [19:42] Muhammad: Brother, this is my last question to you regarding technology and as a pilgrim. It's about an app. What if there was an app that offered spiritual guidance, on top of hotel logistics and location details? Plus, when you go for Ziyarah, it would have descriptions and significance of various places. And after Hajj, there would be a program with Islamic scholars or life coaches to help people maintain the spirit of Hajj. For instance, the idea could be that after you perform Hajj, you plan for one year: I will pray regularly in congregation for a year, give this much in charity, and perform Tahajjud once a week. The app would remind you of these things. And another feature could be if you plan to perform Umrah two years later, it gives you a financial plan, like how you can save five lakh Taka per month for two years. If there was such an app, would people use it? Would they pay for it?\n[20:56] Samee: Yes, yes, this is definitely important. I am also thinking about an SIP model, a Systematic Investment module, you might know it as SIP, which can help someone plan for their Hajj by saving small amounts over time. If there are such guidelines or modules in an app, it would be good. Reminders would be good. [21:30] Muhammad: Brother, since you are a business entrepreneur and you also work with crowdfunding in many cases, do you think it's possible from an investment perspective to have a very defensive investment like this? Where the chance of loss is very low. Or in that case, pilgrims would deposit some money. Even if they get a limited profit, it would make their Hajj journey easier. Is it possible to design such a portfolio, right? According to your language? [22:04] Samee: Yes, it is possible, we are working on it. [22:07] Muhammad: Okay, now let me ask Rafi Bhai a few simple questions about his experience. Insha'Allah, you are starting your journey with the Ummah Hajj Portal. So, Insha'Allah, you will be in management, and you are also, Insha'Allah, hoping to go for Hajj next year. Since you have never been before, what things do you personally find challenging? What things are you confused about? What things make you feel scared, which you feel would be better if you had extra support?\n[22:45] Rafiuzzaman: Firstly, going to the House of Allah as a guest of Allah, there's a good fear that I will have the opportunity to go to such a place of Allah. Secondly, the places where Rasulullah (peace be upon him) and the Sahaba (companions) most frequently visited, where their Dawah (preaching) efforts involved sweat and blood, from Medina to Uhud to the places in Mecca, there's a feeling in my heart to go to these places. Because for those who study Seerah (biography of the Prophet), Mecca and Medina are very much related to them. So, there's a fascination to go to these places, Insha'Allah. If you talk about management, Alhamdulillah. In this case, for example, the pilgrims we are currently in contact with have many questions. They want everything good. They want good hotels, they want to stay closer, they want all transportation facilities. There are some such issues. And we also encounter those who have foreign citizenship but wish to go with a Bangladeshi passport. They have such a desire, but they don't have a Bangladeshi passport, and they are seeking advice on what to do. Overall, what we are facing is that there are some pilgrims who only see it as a trip, only focusing on the generic aspect, like \"I'm just going, that's it.\" It's not like that. Whether we can properly make them understand that this is a spiritual journey and that they need to take it that way, that is a challenging issue for us, to make them feel that. And another challenging issue for us is that there are many people here, yes, who gather five or five and a half lakh Taka with great difficulty, by selling land or by any means. And they want this to be money earned through their hardship. Yes, so our challenge is to provide them with complete support and good service at a low cost or at the minimum economic level. [24:59] Muhammad: I understand, brother. However, brother, let me share a few things here. Since you will Insha'Allah also be working as a Hajj trainer, I've received feedback, especially from some very close people of mine who went for Hajj this year, they were all Canada-based. Their challenge was that they couldn't attend these trainings because the trainings were live and they couldn't enjoy them much if they attended too late. Now, since tech platforms have advanced so much, do you think technology can play a good role in the Hajj training modules to help pilgrims be spiritually and mentally prepared?\n[25:52] Rafiuzzaman: What I mean is, when you train pilgrims to go for Hajj, spiritually and mentally, do you think technology can play a good role in helping with the training sessions? I think specifically that technology can help here, especially for training sessions, because many might not be able to attend physical training, or their locations might be different, someone from Chittagong, someone from other countries, right? So in this case, technology will definitely play a good role. Be it Zoom, Meet, or any kind of custom-made platform that gives us a good meeting interface and allows us to provide one-to-one guidance to pilgrims through good presentations. If such technology is better than Zoom, I hope it will be very good for us to train them up. [27:07] Muhammad: So Rafi Bhai, you are a trainer contracted with One Ummah, but you are also a preacher, and many people benefit from you. Now, many Ummah might only be able to take a maximum of 500 or 1000 pilgrims, but it seems that many more people could benefit in terms of Islamic knowledge. In that case, do you think that your training modules can certainly be opened for other pilgrims besides One Ummah, for a fee, technologically, just a [inaudible]?\n[27:42] Rafiuzzaman: There's a slight mismanagement, I mean, a misunderstanding here. It's that I'm not in training management. Currently, I'm in charge of the entire setup management, as the head of this section. It seems that we can hire trainers from Shepherd. We can hire them, right? For our perspective, we can bring them to provide good guidance to our pilgrims. To bring in good Hajj trainers. Yes. We are keeping this option open, it's not like our people have to do it. We can bring good people from outside, any good scholars, and arrange a training system through them. [28:44] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's move on to the Hajj journey, brother. During the Hajj journey, a person usually stays for 20 to 40 days, and often it is seen that pilgrims' spiritual engagement is not very deep, except for a few two-hour sessions. But this 20 to 40 days can be created as a spiritual boot camp for serious pilgrims, who can use this event as a pivotal moment for their Islamic spirituality, so that after this event, their Islamic practice can improve. So, in this case, how do you think you can plan this 20-day period for pilgrims as a spiritual boot camp through technology? [29:43] Rafiuzzaman: If I talk about the use of technology in Hajj, one of the main objectives of our initiative is to connect pilgrims with Mecca and Medina, to make them feel it, which perhaps only a handful of others do. We want to give our best in this field so that pilgrims can feel why they are going for Hajj. So, in this case, for example, if we want to connect them during the other 20 days, these places in Mecca and Medina where the Sahaba (companions) trod, where Rasulullah (peace be upon him) walked, where Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and his family walked - when we connect them historically to these places, after giving a brief beforehand, relating a story from the Seerah (biography of the Prophet) or what happened at that time in that place, yes, you know, we are going to a place whose history is this, which is related to this verse of the Quran, there are related Hadith, the Sahaba used to think this way - after giving such a brief, when we go to the place, then a...\n[31:07] Rafiuzzaman: ...we can use a device technologically if it's good for us. For example, we can give each pilgrim something like an air-type device in their ear, and I have a microphone. So, there won't be a noisy situation like using a loudspeaker or anything like that. I'll be talking, and my pilgrims will hear me clearly. Yes, they will be watching and connecting with my words. This technology can be a very good asset for all these connections. You understand what I'm saying? Like a radio system. In noisy environments, you know that if you use a mic, the police will catch you and take you to the police station. So, in this case, you can use technology for this purpose during the 20-day Ziyarah part. For example, we usually use WhatsApp call-to-all or Meet regularly. Sometimes, it gets disconnected or has various problems. If we can use exclusive tech to communicate there, it would be better. We recently heard that Europeans use such tech, devices in their ears while walking, and they hear very clearly. [32:51] Samee: And within those 20 days, brother, what do you know? I think Hajj should be about total, complete grooming first. And then, once you're there, for those 20 days, I think I can only dedicate a maximum amount of time to the Kaaba in Mecca. My education part there will be less. There can be reminders, a framing schedule, charts indicating \"20 days left, 18 days left, 17 days left, what have you done?\" Yes, there can be a checklist there, you understand? I think technology should be engaged in such a way that it doesn't take up too much time there. Just a framework. Like how we write things down manually, instead of using paper, there can be a chart there. You understand?\n[33:57] Samee: And regarding Ziyarah, brother, what he said is very good, even if he didn't mention it. In Ziyarah, the environment is noisy. Many people don't know things. And I think it's about just having something like \"I have this much time left for reminder,\" these kinds of things can be done. And documentation will be there. And I think during that time, the most important thing is the connection between Allah and His servant. If someone doesn't know Du'a, it can be written in Bengali, or they can say it in Bengali. Yes, some inspiration can be given that even if you can't do anything else, talk about these things. Sometimes you see how Arabs make Du'a, it feels like they are playing a Test match and we are playing a T20, something like that. We can't do it like them sometimes, and we can't say it the way they do. I've noticed a lot of difference in the style of making Du'a between Bangladeshis, Arabs, and non-Arabs. When they make Du'a, it feels like they are talking right now, you understand? But for us, it seems our connection isn't that strong. They might be smoking cigarettes, whatever it is neutral, what they are saying. But when they make Du'a, what I see is that it feels like they are so close to Allah. We don't feel that close. So, to establish connectivity with Allah, Du'a is the best thing. If those things are there properly, Alhamdulillah.\n[35:36] Muhammad: Samee Bhai, let me ask a question here. There are some etiquettes for Du'a. For example, first, praising Allah. Then, sending Salawat (blessings) upon Rasulullah (peace be upon him). After that, making the Du'as. Then, Du'a can be augmented. For example, you can make Du'a using the names of Allah. Through your good deeds. Then, again, you might need something, but you know that some of your brothers also need it. When you make Du'a for your brothers, the angels will make Du'a for you. There are some techniques for Du'a that Rasul [inaudible]. [36:20] Samee: This time, when making Du'a, for example, I wrote down three or four pages, and I couldn't even manage to follow them, you understand? I don't know, I saw that others' situations were even worse than mine. My situation was bad, that's why I wrote some things, step by step, to help myself. So I remember it, I make Du'a, then I look at it again and read, and then make Du'a again. I saw, even at Rawdah, they were making Du'a as if they could see him right there, brother, talking in Arabic. That's why I mentioned these things.\n[37:19] Muhammad: Samee Bhai, I made a small tool that I'll share with you. It's like, when you make a list of Du'as in the same way, what the AI will do is take your Du'a list and augment it. For example, before each Du'a in the list, it will add some names of Allah. For Rasulullah (peace be upon him), what will it add? It can add Durud (salutations). It will add that. What kind of Du'a intention should it be? Then it will search if Rasulullah (peace be upon him) taught any such Arabic Du'a, and it will add those Du'as. After that, it will make your Du'a beautiful by including the Muslim Ummah, how to include those around you, etc. Do you think a Du'a crafting tool like this, just as we use AI to write applications or for office work, why shouldn't we call upon Allah beautifully? So, can we learn these things from AI?\n[38:20] Samee: Yes, yes, it can be done, it can be done. [38:23] Muhammad: Ultimately, the knowledge comes from Rasulullah (peace be upon him), and AI is just helping to explain it. Right. Yes. [38:29] Muhammad: Okay, Rafi Bhai, last question regarding this, then we'll move to management-related questions. It's about the post-Hajj period. We often see that after Hajj and Umrah, there's a great enthusiasm, but after three months, it's often back to how it was. For this, do you think we can have a post-Hajj boot camp, at least one month or one year, with monthly or bi-monthly check-ins for pilgrims? Can such a program be kept to maintain the spirit of Hajj? [39:20] Rafiuzzaman: Yes, that would be good.\n[39:23] Muhammad: Okay, brother, now let's move to the management side. So, what I've seen from the management is when... [39:28] Samee: Brother, let me tell you, Insha'Allah, we will be able to give more time later. We have two guests waiting outside for us. [39:34] Muhammad: Okay, alright, then let's conclude for today. Insha'Allah, I will sit with you another day, okay? [39:41] Samee: Yes, I am available tomorrow as well, no problem. [39:43] Muhammad: Alright, brother, Insha'Allah, Assalamu Alaikum. [39:46] Samee: Okay, okay, brother, okay, Assalamu Alaikum."

    "english_transcript": "[00:00] Muhammad: Meeting being recorded.\n[00:01] Muhammad: Assalamu Alaikum, brother, you can hear me, right?\n[00:03] Abdullah Hasan: Walaikum Assalam, yes brother, I can hear you.\n[00:04] Muhammad: Okay brother, let me give you some context. Alhamdulillah, you've heard of Hasan Peace, right?\n[00:09] Abdullah Hasan: Yes, I first saw their name at the Lead Summit yesterday, behind it. Brother Omar gave a talk there, I think.\n[00:18] Muhammad: Okay, so I recently participated in one of their programs. From there, I was working on the Hajj Umrah app that I shared with you. They asked me to work on a user survey, to work with those who have performed Hajj or Umrah. So, Allah willing, the goal here is to do user variation and get feedback from someone like you, Alhamdulillah, who is quite hands-on with technology and who has performed Hajj and Umrah once. What challenges did you face? What are your main pain points that you think technology can solve for us, right? Okay.\n[00:39] Muhammad: Brother, let's start. In which year did you perform Hajj?\n[00:41] Abdullah Hasan: Mine was in 2023. And was your Umrah in February 2025 the only Umrah trip? This was the only Umrah trip.\n[00:48] Muhammad: Okay, in which month did you perform that Umrah before?\n[00:50] Abdullah Hasan: It was in February.\n[00:51] Muhammad: Okay, you went on this trip with their guide for Sabar, right? I went with Sabar.\n[00:54] Muhammad: Since you went with Sabar, did you feel any pain that the things they promised you initially – how they would arrange the hotel, how they would provide things, how they would arrange the car – were not delivered that way? Did you face anything like that, or did they manage to deliver what they promised, Alhamdulillah?\n[01:03] Abdullah Hasan: Actually, I wouldn't say they fully delivered everything. It's a much bigger challenge with other agencies, but we didn't face that much. Although they told us that they would keep us in this area on Ajyad Road, at this distance. So, they kept us pretty much at the distance they mentioned, as far as I remember. But when they said that, it seemed relatively easy to us, like \"Okay, it will be within 800 meters or 700 meters.\" But in practical terms, when we went, we saw that it was a bit of an uphill and downhill road, which caused us quite a challenge in commuting, especially when we had to climb the slopes of the mountain. So, I wouldn't say they completely failed to keep their commitment because they told us it would be within 700-800 meters, but we only understood how difficult it would be after we got there. This was in Makkah. And in Madinah, they also said 800 meters, but we saw that it became 1 kilometer. The hotel distance to enter the Haram was about 1 kilometer or more. So, that was also very difficult for us, walking so far with my father and mother to pray. That was also a challenge. They admitted various difficulties there, saying that it wasn't available at that time, there was too much pressure. And indeed, there was a lot of pressure at that time. We didn't face as much crowd or pressure during Hajj as we did during that time when we performed it. Okay, apart from this, this was in the month of Shaban, according to the Arabic calendar. So, we performed our second Umrah of that Umrah trip after coming from Ta'if. That day was the night of 14th Shaban, which we call Shab-e-Barat in Bangladesh. So, we assumed that all the Pakistanis, Indians, and Bangladeshis working in the surrounding areas rushed there to perform Umrah on the night of Shab-e-Barat. We faced more crowd than Hajj on that night. Usually, when we perform Umrah, we can legally do Tawaf on the ground floor. That day, after three or four circuits, we couldn't stay there with our child. Our child was about six or seven months old then. So, we came out from there. After that, we performed Tawaf from the upper floor, from a distance on the second floor of the building. So, there was that much pressure. That was completely beyond our imagination, such a crowd.\n[02:44] Muhammad: I understand, I understand. What were your expectations for the budget you had? Like, what kind of hotel, how far from the Haram?\n[02:51] Abdullah Hasan: Our budget was probably around 1.5 lakh or 1.55 lakh [BDT], roughly. Now, with Sabar, the case is a bit different. Sabar's package wasn't just an Umrah package; they included it as a Seerah program, where we would have several classes on Seerah, and the Seerah guide, Qobid Anwar Bhai, was there, along with Shibli Mehedi Bhai. So, their costing was also added to this. Because of that, other Umrah packages might have been able to provide a hotel closer to the Haram for 1.5 lakh or 1.6 lakh, which they probably couldn't because a large cost went there. So, from that perspective, I would say the cost was pretty much fair, as there was an additional cost involved. But overall, their arrangements for classes were quite good from many aspects. For example, before bringing us, they took us to a park-like area at the foot of a mountain in Madinah, where we had our last class. So, there are some very beautiful and good memories like that. And the most significant positive difference between our Hajj journey and Umrah journey was the people, the travel companions. We faced quite a challenge with the people on our Hajj journey, as their mindset wasn't similar to ours. But here, most of the people were young, several were from the software industry, and every person was practicing and held good opinions of each other, and were good people. Because of them, our Umrah trip, Alhamdulillah, went very well overall. So, now if you were given an option again, say a 1.5 lakh BDT package. But here, let's say I give you three options: one, you'll get a hotel a bit closer, but you'll go with your family, okay? Another option is it will cost a bit less than 1.5 lakh BDT, but you'll be accommodated in the same type of hotel but with unknown people, like it could be elderly people, or any kind of people. And the third option is Sabar's package, where you'll be kept in a distant hotel but you'll get the added values. Which one would you choose?\n[05:07] Muhammad: Am I going alone or with my family?\n[05:09] Abdullah Hasan: Suppose you are going alone, and your family is also going. Which would you choose in both cases?\n[05:11] Muhammad: If I talk about both separately, if I actually—from my Hajj journey, I tell many people around me, or I also feel that I am not interested in staying with unknown people or those I don't know. Because I genuinely cannot bear the pains I've experienced. If necessary, I would spend a bit more money. Even then, I would prefer to stay according to my own preferences. Plus, I've personally thought that perhaps we can go alone later, arrange it ourselves, it might be possible to go without any agency. That could also happen.\n[05:58] Muhammad: Is that if you go alone, or if you go with family?\n[05:59] Abdullah Hasan: Even if I go with family, even if I go with family. Because I've been twice, so from that perspective, agencies don't seem very essential anymore. Even on this trip, I was thinking of going alone.\n[06:12] Muhammad: Okay. So, you're preferring to do your DIY Umrah now. When it comes to going alone, what happens is, you saw that when you went to [Umrah], a guide took you, took you nicely to your hotel. After that, all your transportation was very easy. In that case, you had no worries because the person arranging it was with you and everything was managed. Now, everyone in Bangladesh complains, what if I get scammed when I go there? What if I don't get a taxi, or a car? How will things work? Many people commonly face situations where they went, but the hotel they booked wasn't actually there, and then they had to stay on the street. Do you consider this a challenge? If not, how do you plan to mitigate these issues if you go alone?\n[07:11] Abdullah Hasan: If I go alone, my first challenge is actually getting tickets. And recently, I heard something like visas are issued only upon receiving an email from hotels available on Nusuk. So, that hotels not on Nusuk cannot be released. So, this is my first challenge. In this case, I might be able to get support from known elder brothers and sisters who can book my tickets or connect me with a hotel like that. Plus, I spoke to another younger brother, and he gave me a tip: \"You can stay a bit far from the Haram, in a five-star hotel. Shuttle services are available from there, every 10 minutes or half an hour, 24 hours a day. You can get off below the Haram and then go back.\" That could also be an option. Okay, let me go in order. Then comes tickets, tickets are done. After getting there, then transportation. For this, I've thought of keeping a SIM card with roaming service. When I land there, I can book with Careem or similar services available from the airport and go to the hotel, Inshallah. There won't be any difficulty with that. And if I get to the hotel and see that I've been scammed, my booking is canceled, even then, there's no problem. There are plenty of hotels nearby, I'll just check into one. It might be a bit more troublesome, but manageable.\n[08:14] Muhammad: Okay, I understand. Alhamdulillah. If we talk about taxi or train, regarding taxis, do you think that because Careem is not very available in Makkah? In many places it might be available, but then again, when going from Makkah to Madinah, sometimes long trips come up. In that case, if you have two options, you can hail a taxi or ride in a car, or you can take the train. Which would be your preference? Same for the airport. Which would be your preference?\n[08:44] Abdullah Hasan: Which one costs the same among these two?\n[08:46] Muhammad: The train fare is a bit higher, but the train journey and train fare are a bit higher, and as far as I know, the train allows one luggage. With a taxi, you have to haggle; if you can haggle, you might get a lower price or a higher price. It varies season to season depending on your bargaining. If you have known people or someone arranges it, you might get it for less. But there's a chance that they might not show up, meaning there's some uncertainty involved. It also takes a bit more time because the train travels very fast.\n[09:22] Abdullah Hasan: No, if a person can only carry one piece of luggage, then this limitation would make it difficult for me to go from Makkah to Madinah if I have more than one piece of luggage. In that case, there's no alternative to a taxi or bus service. So, if bus service is available, I can take the bus. Otherwise, I'll take a taxi. I understand. Okay, you were there. You ate, you shopped, you spent good time there. How easy was it for you to find good hotels or good shopping malls? Did you know where to go? Did someone take you, or did it take you a few days to find something good?\n[10:11] Abdullah Hasan: Yes, I think it takes anyone two or four days when they go there. Because after such a long journey and immediately performing Umrah, it puts a lot of pressure on the body. For the first two or three days, there isn't much opportunity to look at anything else. And after that, what happened during my Hajj journey was that I first went up to Safa Tower. And below Safa Tower, there are many shops, many markets, and Zamzam nearby. So, we pretty much understood from there that these hotels have shops. Apart from that, no one really needed to show us around that much. So, our boundary was pretty much limited to Safa Tower, Zamzam Tower, and towards Ibrahim Khalil Road, that big road, these few places. There are many wholesale markets in other places; we didn't even get to go to those, we didn't get the opportunity.\n[11:09] Muhammad: If you knew that for instance, in Kakia, you could find wholesale items cheaply, or in Madinah, there are some open date markets. If you knew about these places, or if there were some popular food spots, would you have attempted to go, or would you have mainly focused on worship?\n[11:27] Abdullah Hasan: I would have probably tried to go from time to time. Our main goal during the Hajj journey was to pray in the Haram, so we wouldn't go too far, we would skip that. But occasionally, if there was an opportunity, we would definitely go. For example, I heard about Albaik. I've been on two journeys but never got to eat Albaik because there aren't any big, good Albaik shops near the Haram. So, we mainly ate Arabian food, more than Bengali food, Arabian and Malaysian food. Romancia, Romancia, there was one below Safa Tower. Adra Mouth, we mainly ate at those places. But there's definitely a fascination to try such traditional local food if we knew about it or if someone guided us, we would definitely try it.\n[12:12] Muhammad: When you were shopping, buying things, do you feel that, for example, where you were, Safa Tower, these are very touristy areas, and prices there are a bit higher. You can go a bit further inside, there are some places where you can find things a bit cheaper. Not a huge difference, but a little cheaper. But sometimes, you might miss prayers in the Haram. You might need to take a taxi to go there. If that's the case, would you be interested in perhaps going and seeing it for one or two meals, but not on a regular basis? Is that my understanding, right?\n[12:54] Abdullah Hasan: Yes, that could happen. But even for cheaper items, what we observed around the Haram in Makkah is that if it's slightly cheaper, the quality often degrades significantly, meaning there are quite a lot of ups and downs in quality. So, the understanding from that was somewhat like, \"Okay, if you buy something a bit more expensive, there's no loss.\" So, buying from around the Haram is okay. We didn't actually have a big shopping budget or a target for shopping, which is why we didn't worry about it much. We bought one or two jubbas and one or two burqas. We didn't buy much more than that.\n[13:30] Muhammad: Okay. Now you mentioned that a main value-added service you felt was guidance. For this guidance, are you paying extra money? Now, if it's like this: you get this guidance through an on-demand app, or there's a physical guide there, or you went alone and they provide this service for money. Would you buy this, or would you prefer to handle it yourselves?\n[13:58] Abdullah Hasan: My case is actually a bit different. For example, I'm thinking that I won't go with any agency. Because agencies usually include various internal Ziyarats (visits to historical sites). Since I've been twice, I don't feel the need to go to those types of places anymore. So, I would rather prefer an exclusive service for places I haven't visited but are historically famous or worth seeing. For example, I think some Bangladeshi students from Madinah University provide such services; they rent a taxi and accompany as guides to describe the history of those places, as they are quite knowledgeable about them. If such a service exists, yes, I will take it, Inshallah. But for the day-to-day, regular Ziyarats that agencies usually offer, I don't have that much interest anymore.\n[15:02] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, I understand. And brother, how did the agency communicate and handle things with you? Was it all through WhatsApp groups, right?\n[15:07] Abdullah Hasan: Yes, with Sabar, everything was through WhatsApp. Even during the previous Hajj, I communicated and messaged the agency from time to time via WhatsApp. Do you think it's an effective way of communicating, or does it create a lot of gaps? In my case, I didn't feel such a problem. One challenge is that WhatsApp calls don't work after going to Saudi Arabia. So, our instruction there was to send voice messages on WhatsApp or call on Telegram. But it's still manageable. It doesn't cause much trouble. And one package is bought anyway. From that, you can talk directly with the SIM. So, I don't think much more is needed beyond WhatsApp.\n[15:52] Muhammad: Does your mobile support eSIM?\n[15:54] Abdullah Hasan: No, my current mobile probably doesn't support eSIM. It's a physical SIM.\n[15:59] Muhammad: If you are asked to add some money to your package, which might be a bit more than buying a SIM there because usually a 50 riyal SIM works fine there. But if you are told that you have to pay 80 riyals, but you can take a SIM from Bangladesh, so you don't have any hassle of buying it there. You can use it there. Would you buy it or buy it there?\n[16:29] Abdullah Hasan: No, I wouldn't buy it. I might not even buy a SIM at all. I remember my Hajj journey. For the first month, my wife and I didn't buy any SIM card. We were completely without a SIM for one month. We bought a package for the last 15 days because that was the main Hajj period. So, we saw that it's actually possible to manage without a SIM; it's not difficult. Losing each other or communicating when two people go in different directions is not a problem.\n[17:03] Abdullah Hasan: Sometimes there are some problems, but that was planned beforehand. For example, we'd enter for Maghrib prayer, \"Okay, you go, I'll come out after Isha prayer, wait in front of that gate or that hotel.\" So, we managed like that for the first month. And when we came back to the hotel, the hotel Wi-Fi was available, so there was no problem communicating with the child. But once or twice, such an issue occurred on this Umrah trip itself, where I said to stay in one place, but then I thought, \"Oh, I should actually be in that other place.\" So, when I went there, I couldn't find them. Then I remembered, \"Oh, we also said to stand there.\" When I went there, I saw them standing there. So, we had to wait for about 15-20 minutes or half an hour. So, one or two such incidents happened. But it's still manageable. I don't think paying 80 Riyals from Bangladesh instead of 35 or 50 Riyals is that urgent for buying a SIM.\n[18:14] Muhammad: I understand, brother. So, the summary is that you would prefer to go for a 'do-it-yourself' Umrah moving forward. Now, let me ask you a hypothetical question. Technically, you've never performed Hajj or Umrah before. But there's a mobile app to guide you, which can show you where to go with Google Maps, you can book your rides there, you can do everything through the app. In that case, would you suggest someone going for the first time to try doing it themselves, or would it be very challenging?\n[18:38] Abdullah Hasan: No, I think it would be very challenging. It's a completely unfamiliar country, no one understands the language, no one understands the roads. So, I think it would be very challenging.\n[18:48] Muhammad: Okay. So, you think that first-timers should always go with an agency, and then from the second time onwards, you can go by yourself, Inshallah, there won't be any problem. Brother, now for the final part. This is a bit different. We want to know some of your perspectives. You are, Alhamdulillah, a mobile app developer. You are the founder of Muslims. So, the challenges you faced, what do you think can be solved through mobile apps or this technology, now that machine learning and AI are so advanced? What are the things you can solve that pilgrims actually face challenges with?\n[19:40] Abdullah Hasan: Okay, if I'm asked what challenges I faced, well, one challenge is different for different people. For me, the challenge, which keeps coming up in my words, was the travel companions on my first journey. And on my second journey, it was the distance. So, these things, for me, to overcome them with technology, one would need to think a lot more about whether there are use cases for these. But for many, there might be use cases where they don't understand where they are or the fear of getting lost, which many people have, or senior citizens have a different kind of challenge. My challenge, however, is different. Because there's a big aspect of mindset here. For example, it was never a big challenge for me if I had less food or didn't get food, or if I got lost somewhere or couldn't find my way home. So, regarding the mindset I mentioned, we had, by Allah's grace, prepared for about a year beforehand, thinking about what to do and what not to do, what's appropriate, what's inappropriate, where to compromise, and where not to get into arguments. It's like we went through a mental and spiritual training. Because of this, by Allah's grace, many things became easy for us. For example, I remember our Hajj journey; we walked from Arafat to Muzdalifah, and from Muzdalifah to Jamarat, we left our team and didn't come with our agency because they were delaying too much. We walked such a long distance, it was very challenging, walked more than 8-9 kilometers. But even then, it didn't feel so bad to me. I'll just consider it mindset here. So, for these areas, I don't really see a use case. Now, from the perspective of those managing, there might be some use cases for how to provide further service using machine learning, AI, or technology. This could be brainstormed, so their management becomes smoother. For example, when I went with Sabar, I saw that their management was weak in many aspects. On our Umrah Hajj journey there, I also saw that the management was very weak. There was only one person. So, he really couldn't get these things organised.\n[21:50] Muhammad: He couldn't get [things] organised. The pilgrims wouldn't listen to him. Everyone went in different directions. There was no time schedule, no maintenance. These things might be improved somewhat with some technical solutions of this type. Another thing that could be done is, if there's something in the app about where we're going—it definitely should be there. If there's an app that gives a brief about where we're going, like \"we're going to such and such place, its short history is like this,\" and it could have animations or live videos of that place, so people can actually connect. Because it shouldn't just be an XYZ type of tour. In this area, perhaps people can be kept more spiritually connected through various stories of the Seerah, information about different places, and ideas. That's it. I understand. So, you're saying it can help as a spiritual component. So, if we talk about spirituality, brother, you said you studied a lot before, then you did training, and then you handled all these things. And then there are the Sharia matters, like how to perform Tawaf, how to perform Sa'i. People usually read these from a small book. But these things can also be kept as offline content in the app. I think you're already [doing this]. Yes. So, do you think these would add value for people?\n[23:05] Abdullah Hasan: Yes, it can add value. Because I've seen that it's easier for people to carry a phone now than a book. Books feel difficult to many now. Although I actually always kept a hardcopy book with me. It was always inside my Ihram belt. It was Mufti Muhammad Yahya Saheb's book, the Imam and Khatib of Molla Mosque. I did Hajj training from him. So, a book like that, or category-wise Masail (religious rulings) or books for those who follow specific Imams of different madhhabs, or another great thing could be a checklist. Like, I've started an Umrah. The checklist is in that small book I used to follow, it's at the back of the book. So, Mufti Yahya Saheb used to say that when you start Umrah, you do one task after another from here and tick it off. And ticking it off with a pen or pencil there is difficult. You can keep a note that if the app has a checklist for Umrah, what are the Sunnahs, everything from minor details, so that I don't miss anything. So, having such a mobile app would be helpful in that regard, quite helpful. Because often, people get separated from their group, and then they have to perform Umrah alone. For example, with our Sabar group, two of my colleagues went with me. One colleague got lost right at the beginning, during the first circuit. But Alhamdulillah, he said he managed to do it properly. So, if this is also in a mobile app, it would be a very good thing, Inshallah.\n[24:43] Muhammad: Okay, brother. And if these are in the app, in that case, do you think you would be willing to pay for it, even for a simple app?\n[24:50] Abdullah Hasan: Hmm, it depends. I think instead of directly taking payment from the pilgrims, it might be better to communicate with agencies, so you take payment from the agency, and the agency adjusts it with the pilgrims. Because, for Bangladeshi people, this culture of paying for apps hasn't really developed yet. But maybe for foreign countries, it exists. If there are no free, authentic, reliable resources available in the market—I haven't really researched which apps offer such services—but it could be worth looking into. If it turns out that the benefits I'm getting from this are not provided by any free software or are not organized as well, then in that case, I think it can be paid for. Because someone who is spending 1.5 lakh, 2 lakh Taka for Umrah, if they buy a subscription for two, four, five hundred, or a thousand Taka from this, it doesn't seem like too much for them if the value can be explained to them.\n[25:56] Muhammad: Yes, because you said an offline app can be an alternative to a book. In that case, people were spending four or five hundred Taka to buy books. In that case, let me ask the last question, brother, about AI Guide. Now, if it's like this, if a mobile app has an AI engine behind it that is trained entirely on Hajj and Umrah rulings, would you be comfortable asking it basic rulings, like how to perform Sa'i, how to perform Tawaf, what is this Dua?\n[26:30] Abdullah Hasan: Yes, technology has advanced a lot now. In such simple areas, perhaps one could ask. Many might do so. But personally, I would stay a bit away from this. It's entirely my personal preference. Many people readily take Masail (religious rulings) from ChatGPT and even share them publicly. That's a different case. But personally, I don't think I would take Masala from an AI-based source right now. That's why, during my Hajj and Umrah journeys, I connected with an Alim (religious scholar) when I went there. I told him, \"Brother, throughout the journey, I will be contacting you a lot, calling, knocking, messaging at odd hours for various Masail.\" So, if you have a system like this in the app, where there will be live human beings, Mufti sahibs or scholars, who can provide urgent support in different languages—many people need this, like if they are in the Mina field late at night, and it's deep night in Bangladesh, then whom will they call for a Masala? Agencies don't always have scholars. The Muallim (Hajj guide) is also mostly a general graduate. For this reason, if there's a service like this in the app, where I can talk to a live Mufti about my exact problem and get an answer, that could also be a good service.\n[27:58] Muhammad: I understand. Okay. So, if you know it will be like this, many questions will come to the Mufti. To help him, there will be one [AI]. Your question will be one. The Mufti will just show it, the Mufti will copy-paste it for you. Would you be comfortable with that, or does the Mufti have to give it himself?\n[28:07] Abdullah Hasan: That can be acceptable if a human being reviews it; then I have no problem with it. For example, [AI Q&A], I think Brother shared with us that this type of AI is trained specifically for Masala Masael. So, we are thinking of bringing something like this to our MuslimJet. But it will not directly interact with people. The question's answe—\n[28:13] Muhammad: It will prepare the answer with references and give it to the Mufti. The Mufti will just tick it saying \"Okay.\" So, if that happens, I'm okay with it. Now, we often do something where, for any Masala, we search on IslamQA or check a book reference ourselves. Now, if AI doesn't say anything on its own, but rather directly takes your problem and finds a similar Masala for you, and you have to judge whether it aligns with your Masala—for example, how do I perform Sa'i? It doesn't say anything itself, but quickly searches and provides you with a Hadith on how the Prophet [peace be upon him] did it. Would you be comfortable using it as a search tool without a Mufti?\n[29:05] Abdullah Hasan: Yes, I would. So, that would be helpful for me. But I would also say that this is a bit of an advanced feature for many people. It might not be suitable for everyone. Because I've explored those areas a bit, it might be easier for me to understand which websites to take from, which not to take from, or what to look for to understand whether it should be taken or not. So, for those who can verify it themselves, I think it's fine for them.\n[29:43] Muhammad: And brother, you said you were already well-trained on how to go, what tasks to do, meaning you were mentally prepared. So, do you think if there's a program in an app, where you join a training through the app? Like, you do it one month before Hajj or 15 days before Umrah, you learn on a regular basis from there, and even after Hajj or Umrah is over, you continue practicing the lessons from there on a regular basis. And in this case, you are charged a six-month or three-month subscription fee. Would you be interested in using something like that?\n[29:56] Abdullah Hasan: Actually, in this area, water from 11 AM, okay.\n[29:58] Muhammad: Okay brother, now the thing here is that it might be suitable for some people. It can act as a helper. There's no alternative to going to scholars, actually. So, for me, it was helpful that I was physically present at Mufti [Yahya] Saheb's three-day course there. That was very helpful. Plus, I had read quite a few books for about a year beforehand. Not just about Masail, but also to mentally prepare for the spiritual aspect of the journey, like Abu Mezbah Saheb's books, then Safar-e-Hijaz, and other Hajj travelogues. These were very helpful for me. So, if there's a six-month or three-month course like this, it might be helpful for many people, especially for senior citizens, as it might not be very easy for them to learn directly from scholars. Plus, if there's an opportunity to watch recorded classes alongside live classes. Because I've seen that our roommates, the uncles, if we tell them a Masala like, \"Uncle, this is how it is,\" they forget it right away. They keep watching it repeatedly, keep revising it. So, if there's an opportunity to practice these things through an app, it can be beneficial.\n[31:30] Muhammad: Brother, you are muted.\n[31:32] Muhammad: If I summarize the use of the app, you could say that what you are suggesting is a small training before Hajj, and having a Hajj and Umrah ritual checklist with scholars during Hajj time. And after that, if some live guidance is available from a scholar, or if a live Masala is searched and provided to me. I think you feel that this thing can help you as an app. Plus, if it's also the case that you might not know many places. If the app can arrange a guide for you for convenience, saying you can go here. This place has this attribute. This place is famous for this reason. This information would be helpful for you, for a small fee, but it solves your problem.\n[32:27] Abdullah Hasan: Exactly. Plus, descriptions of those places, videos, various pictures, various histories, these things would personally add a lot of value for me. So, I am willing to pay for these.\n[32:38] Muhammad: Brother, for this, what is the maximum amount you would be interested in paying that you think would be fair? If I say the amount in dollar value, is 15 dollars enough or is it too much? I mean, 50 dollars, 15 dollars? Okay, 15 dollars. We will calculate it in Bangladeshi Taka, right? 1500 Taka? I think 1500 Taka might be a bit too much. If it's kept within 500 Taka, I think sales would be higher.\n[32:53] Abdullah Hasan: Okay, brother.\n[32:54] Muhammad: Okay, brother. These were all the questions. Thank you very much, brother, for your time. I really appreciate it.\n[32:58] Abdullah Hasan: Thank you too. I actually, maybe I spoke a lot of [random] things or a lot of...\n[33:02] Muhammad: No, no, brother. You were asking questions in one direction, and I might have been answering in another.\n[33:04] Muhammad: No, no, your feedback was to the point, brother. Alhamdulillah. Helpful, helpful. Alhamdulillah.\n[33:08] Abdullah Hasan: Okay, brother. Assalamu Alaikum. Inshallah, may you be well. Inshallah, we will talk again sometime."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: So, last month I joined an entrepreneurship studio called Hasan VC. From them, I've learned that they help new entrepreneurs establish their businesses. I was interested in working on the Hajj and Umrah domain here. So, they told me the first step is to really find the real pain points in the Hajj and Umrah industry. That's why I'm talking to pilgrims, business owners, and operators from that perspective. I'll probably talk for 25 to 30 minutes and record it, brother, and I'll take your input on what challenges you face, which are a collective issue. Yes, it will be difficult beforehand, right? Finishing within the hour.\nMuhammad: Okay, good, good. Alright brother, Inshallah, let's start. So, first, let's formally get to know your introduction, Inshallah.\nMustafiz: I am Mohammad Mostafizur Rahman. I am in the IT department of an Islamic bank, and I am in charge of information security.\nMuhammad: Okay, brother, you performed Hajj in 2022. Have you ever performed Umrah besides that?\nMustafiz: I performed the obligatory Hajj in 2014, and the one in 2022 was a Badali Hajj (Hajj performed on behalf of someone else).\nMuhammad: Okay, so you haven't performed Umrah before, right?\nMustafiz: Umrah has not been performed.\nMuhammad: Okay, so you have plans to go for Umrah, Inshallah?\nMustafiz: Not at this moment, no. Not exactly at this moment that I will go for Umrah. Okay.\nMuhammad: Brother, let me start by saying that since you have performed Hajj twice, preparation is very important. When you were in the HSC phase, regular workshops were held for this preparation. What challenges did you face in taking this preparation, attending regular workshops, and getting yourself well-prepared?\nMustafiz: The challenges were that when I went in 2014, I felt that there was no proper guidance regarding Hajj at that time. The agencies we went through, mostly religious scholars, had very traditional activities. There was no conventional training, nothing at all. I decided to go for Hajj, and I just contacted my mosque's former Imam in 2014, and he said, \"Okay, let's go with me.\" What he did was arrange all my passport and visa, but he never gave complete information about where we would be staying, how close it was, where we would stay in Madinah, where in Makkah, what their activities would be, when we would depart, or which flight. This information was not known initially, only at the very last moment, sometimes even the day before Hajj, the visa would be issued, and tickets would be arranged. These things were very complex then, and we didn't know. There was no training system. Two days before Hajj, he might rent a room somewhere or gather the pilgrims in a mosque and give a short sermon. But in one day, such a massive activity like Hajj cannot be trained. So, at that time, we faced these issues, realizing that proper training is necessary. By that time, I had some sources, my friends who had gone before. There's a gentleman named Jahid Bhai, a businessman in Siddheshwari, who is a great social worker. You might have heard of Tanvir Bhai, who describes Hajj, they used to give some training there. Dr. Abdullah Hel Baki from Jahangirnagar University, I forgot his name, but he helped us tremendously. His speeches, his descriptions of Hajj were so beautiful. He also teaches free Quran in Savar. And he used to come to Jahid Bhai's place in Siddheshwari and give many lessons on the Quran there. So, since Baki Sir was very experienced in Hajj matters, Hajj teachings were given there. As a result, we learned a lot from there, which we couldn't learn anything from our agency. The agency didn't guide us at all. Everything we learned was through Baki Sir and Jahid Bhai. And we basically performed Hajj with that knowledge. And the guides who took us in 2014, they actually had many problems, which if I hadn't known through Baki Sir, I might have performed Hajj [incorrect/unclear: might have struggled to perform Hajj or performed it incorrectly]. But later, when I went in 2022, my wife somehow knew Shepherd and selected them. After going with Shepherd, we received very good training, and their guidance was excellent. Especially, they included some religious scholars in their marketing, and their guidance was superb. As a result, it's very effective for someone going for the first time. Right? I think in Bangladesh now, some agencies like Shepherd have come forward and are helping in this area. But if we consider the grassroots level, the condition of pilgrims from rural areas or districts is truly pathetic. I mean, truly pathetic. They can't perform many of the Hajj rituals correctly, or they don't know or understand, and they are taken in that state. I think the training part before going for Hajj should be completed most thoroughly in our country, and attention should be given to this.\nMuhammad: I understand, brother. In that case, the training you mentioned, is it both logistical training and spiritual training, or only one?\nMustafiz: It's both. Because, for logistical training, consider someone from a rural area who has never flown on a plane. And has never seen an airport. In many cases, they haven't even ridden an air-conditioned bus. For many, from their home to Makkah for Hajj, and from Makkah back to Bangladesh, they have to perform many steps. And they have to be patient in at least a hundred places. So, these things, the logistical aspects, the physical aspects, are very, very important to learn. And spiritual matters, of course, must be taught. Some might know these in some ways, from books. Right? Many might know by reading books. But especially the logistical support is very crucial. Because of these, our country gets a bad name, and many mistakes are made.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, brother, now after COVID, Zoom, online meetings, online learning have become very common. Many good platforms have emerged. From your perspective, do you think this training can be done entirely online?\nMustafiz: Yes, it can definitely be done online. Because now, many people have become accustomed to online platforms. Even people in villages, one could say in the last two years, have largely adopted it. In that case, online training programs can be conducted for those who are remote. And for those who are close by, physical training is always an option. So, I don't think there's any problem with remote training. Because it's not like there's anything to teach hands-on in remote settings. But the physical aspects of learning, providing them online, is sufficient.\nMuhammad: I understand, brother. Okay, now let's talk about the Hajj journey. The Hajj journey is truly a challenging one. You have to perform some exhaustive processes there. If we consider it this way, please share your suggestions. What challenges did you face during Hajj, and how do you think we can make these easier with technology?\nMustafiz: Actually, the first thing, the problem I faced right from the beginning of the Hajj journey, was that our tickets and visas arrived at the very last moment. I don't know exactly what happened last year in 2025, but when I went in 2022, I faced the issue that the visa and tickets took a long time to arrive, and we found out at the last moment, one or two days before. I think in 2022, we knew about two days in advance or something like that. This matter was a bit complicated in 2022 because it was the first Hajj after COVID, which led to many complications in hotel bookings, but that's a different story. I don't know what happened in the subsequent years, 2023 or 2024, or what happened in 2025, but I think these visa and ticket matters can be completed much earlier. This is an issue that requires intervention from the Bangladesh government. Secondly, for example, in 2022, we had a wonderful experience where we landed in Makkah and immediately got a bus and went. But in 2014, I had to sit in Makkah, in Jeddah, for almost 16 hours. That was a very bad experience for me. The condition at Jeddah airport was so bad that the toilets were overflowing, and water was all over the floor. Even for prayer or ablution, one had to perform it over dirty water; it was such a terrible situation in 2014. Now these things might have improved in Jeddah, but I faced these in 2014 and not in 2022. And the thing is, when we check into hotels from Makkah, at that time, everyone is so exhausted that right after, when it's time to perform Umrah. Everyone is quite tired at that time. So, I think agencies should allow some rest before performing Umrah. In many cases, I've heard that other agencies check into the hotel and immediately go for Umrah. But I think some rest is needed here. Because after such a long journey, it becomes tough to perform Umrah without rest. These are the things I've faced, or I think we have problems, and some others which are spiritual matters that cannot be done due to lack of knowledge. In that case, if you think we make a platform where there's training and such honesty is provided.\nMuhammad: It is possible that there could be long waits, so you should be mentally prepared. Because being mentally prepared often makes things easier. And if we train pilgrims this way, for example, when you go from Makkah, you will perform rituals from Makkah, you might have to sit here with some difficulty, but your journey is for the remembrance of Allah. To worship Allah, you must do so at your destination. Now, you can take it this way, motivation can be given so that people don't get impatient and will sit and wait patiently in that place. Another thing is about Umrah. In the case of Umrah, everyone goes with an agency because there's nervousness. Many people go for Umrah for the first time, and they are afraid of how to perform Umrah. Now, what happens is, for example, when people first go to perform Umrah, their visa might not be there if they don't go during the Hajj season. In that case, if they are trained beforehand, shown Umrah videos, explained things, and given a mobile app. The app could have the four steps of Umrah written, like \"You enter the mosque reciting a dua,\" \"Okay, I've entered, my checkmark,\" then the next step is \"I will find Hajar al-Aswad and start my circumambulation from there\". I remember we were told to follow the green light for Hajar al-Aswad. Brother, by following the green light, someone started the circumambulation from the middle, marking the Hatim. No matter how much I tried to explain that it wouldn't count, he just kept saying, \"I'm following the green light\".\nMustafiz: Yes, yes.\nMuhammad: So, these things should be educated to the pilgrims beforehand. And the same Haji brother was very nervous because he relied on his wife who had done Umrah, thinking he would do it with her, but in that crowd, he lost his wife.\nMustafiz: Yes, yes, yes.\nMuhammad: Then I saw another Haji brother, no, another sister, who lost her husband, and she was crying and doing Sa'i. So now, in this regard, what I felt is that people get very nervous.\nMustafiz: Yes, what do you think about reducing this nervousness?\nMuhammad: Increase people's confidence. For example, give them some mock exercises, quizzes: \"What will you recite upon entering?\" \"How many times will you circumambulate?\" \"What is the dua for Sa'i?\". Prepare them with these things beforehand, and when.\nMustafiz: Let me add something here. Let me add something here. Exactly this kind of problem happened to my elder sister last year, in 2024. Yes, in 2024 she went with her brother-in-law, even though it was their second time. But the agency they went through, an agency from Rajshahi, their performance was exactly what I mentioned about the problems I faced in 2014. And it turned out to be true; they didn't provide any help, they didn't give any training. As a result, my elder sister got lost. How she got lost was that her brother-in-law went one way, and my elder sister took three people and went another way. In the crowd, these three people got separated. And on the first day she went for Umrah, my elder sister didn't even have a SIM card inserted yet. Nothing was set up on her phone. Right? Due to this, my elder sister was almost lost for five or six hours. She was hidden, couldn't be found. Somehow, she later got help from a Bangladeshi and was able to return to her place, even though she remembered her hotel's name, \"Hridoy\". But these issues, what to do if one gets lost?. They panic. Then, if the husband and wife get separated during Tawaf. If someone can't find another during Sa'i. If one performs on the second floor and another on the third, where will they meet? Right? And even if someone gets separated from their group, they should be able to perform their entire Umrah, Sa'i, Tawaf. What you're suggesting, if you can provide these things step-by-step through videos. They can check their own mobile. \"Yes, I've performed this\". \"Now my Tawaf is done, what do I do now?\" \"I'll pray two rakats behind Maqam Ibrahim\" – they see this. After seeing it, they check the location of the Zamzam well according to your map or your guide, your app, go there, drink water, and then go for Sa'i. The app should be designed so they can perform it alone, becoming self-dependent. This is definitely good. Actually, when someone gets lost, if they have a panic button in the app, it's dangerous to move them while they are in the middle of Umrah, or at the end. In that case, the app could give them step-by-step guidance and tell them, \"If you are lost, here is a text in Arabic.\" For example, the text says in Arabic, \"Please show this woman or man where to pray in Maqam Ibrahim.\" \"Show this to a Saudi authority or police\". And pictures of who the police are, who the Saudi authorities are. Show it to someone like that. Then that person will show them, \"Go here, pray here\". Then they pray. After praying, it similarly guides them through Sa'i and Tawaf. And a big problem there is that network data is often not available inside the mosque, so location tracking becomes a bit difficult.\nMuhammad: When their Umrah is finished, it finally tells them, \"Okay, now go to an open area\". \"Come to an open area.\" And suppose there are some points around the mosque for their hotel location. According to that, it takes them to a point, and then guides them to their hotel. Then they won't have this panic. If someone experiences extreme panic like this, and if there is support through an app, they can talk to someone in Bangladesh in their own language who can help them, or their family members can send them a message. Do you think these things would help people?\nMustafiz: Yes, definitely. And one thing, oh, this should definitely be done. And the thing is, I think they should ensure their mobile SIM card immediately after landing in Jeddah. Right? Because right after landing in Jeddah, or checking into the hotel, if they can insert their Saudi mobile SIM before performing Umrah. Then they will be under network coverage. Right? For example, in my elder sister's case, she didn't insert a SIM. She went for Umrah without it. That hurriedness of the agencies. Right? That \"you have to go now, otherwise you won't get time\". Flight schedules from Bangladesh are made in such a way that they don't get time. Then they end up performing Umrah in the late hours of the night. They have to finish before the Fajr adhan. This creates such a rush. So, in these areas, I would emphasize the SIM issue: they should ensure their mobile is under network coverage even before checking into the hotel or after checking in.\nMuhammad: Now, new devices are coming out, and if pilgrims are given an eSIM plan for one or two days, \"This is your temporary one, you can extend it if you want, or you can buy a SIM of your choice\" – an option could be given that there isn't.\nMuhammad: For them, we recommended that you can get a roaming SIM from BanglaLink, Grameenphone, Robi, or Airtel for one or two days.\nMustafiz: For two days, right? Yes.\nMuhammad: Yes, you can change it there later. I think this is a good idea.\nMustafiz: This is a good idea. This must be enforced from Bangladesh itself, that since you cannot or do not want to take an eSIM, you should take roaming for two days from here. Then, when you get there, you can buy a SIM according to your convenience. I think agencies should enforce this.\nMuhammad: Yes, I remember in 2024, one Haji didn't buy a SIM and decided not to.\nMustafiz: Hmm hmm.\nMuhammad: So, what happened was we went to Quba Mosque. And he fell a bit behind. His brother had a SIM, but he was in Medina. Anyway, he somehow missed the bus. He was coming. So, another Haji got off the bus to look for him. Yes, because the Haji who got off.\nMustafiz: That Haji's wife was their roommate.\nMuhammad: Okay, alright. Then what happened was, somehow I was the bus volunteer. We got the impression that he took another bus or something and left. Later, he called and found us, but he was lost, and he took a taxi back to the hotel, very upset. Later we apologized and said, \"No problem, we will take you again, no problem\". In that case, he actually had some trouble, and it was quite an experience that he went missing later. And another problem was that the brother was a very pious person, May Allah bless him. He felt that mobile phones were a distraction, so he often kept his mobile off. That brother also, if we sent a message, we would know they wouldn't get it.\nMuhammad: It was a hassle for us. We had to go to their room and tell them, \"Brother, this has to be done tomorrow.\" There were some hassles like that. Sorry. Okay, brother, now let's move to the next question. You performed Umrah, but if someone wants to perform Umrah again, many people go repeatedly, coming from Ta'if or performing Tawaf repeatedly. In that case, performing Ihram, Umrah, or Tawaf is an exercise where we can make many duas. How did you do these things? Did you write down your duas somewhere, or did you just say whatever came to mind? And do you think you were able to make the duas fully?\nMustafiz: What I did was, I memorized some and carried books with me. Yes, I carried books. And the small books that various agencies provided at different times were useful. They contained many duas. Yes. And if there's an app on the mobile for duas that we can recite during Hajj. If such an app exists, that would be very good. Then I wouldn't have to carry any books. Carrying a book means putting it in a bag. And if it's a book with Quranic verses or even the Quran itself, and I'm placing it below my head, on the ground, while praying. It's below my waist while praying, right? I think these things can be a bit disrespectful. So, if there's an app on the mobile with all kinds of duas that we use during Hajj. For example, there's a dua for Sa'i. Right? Then, basically, there isn't a specific dua for Tawaf, but what to recite during Tawaf or what would be good to do – if these things are in the app, then it's no hassle for anyone. For those who don't use Android phones at all, or use button phones, perhaps those small books are useful. But I think most people now use Android and know how to use it. It seems about 80% of pilgrims are accustomed to Android. In that case, an app could be very helpful and effective.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's talk about the challenges during the days of Hajj. When you talk about the Hajj journey in 2014 or 2022, what challenges did you face spiritually and logistically during the Hajj days? And in that case, please share your ideas on how we can use technology for pilgrims.\nMustafiz: Actually, the biggest problem during the days of Hajj is that on the spiritual side, I didn't see any problem in terms of worship. There's ample opportunity for worship. But the problem is with the physical supports: like walking to the bus, tracking the road during difficulties, gathering everyone when going to throw stones. Right? Getting together as a group. Right? Then, how many stones to throw, how to throw them. Then, when returning, whether we're using the correct path. Right? These things seemed most challenging to me. And on the Day of Arafat, what happened was that bus schedules were missed repeatedly. It seemed like one bus arrived, another didn't. One group left, another stayed. Also, in 2014, I even faced situations where it was 3 AM, and the bus was stuck due to traffic or route changes. In that case, I think for those who are able and can walk, walking eight kilometers from Arafat is not a big deal; they can just walk. And for those who are disabled or elderly, arrangements for vehicles can be made. If agencies can define this from the beginning, then in many cases, I think their work becomes easier, and pilgrims too. For example, when coming from Arafat to Muzdalifah, there's a place whose name I forgot, where the Prophet (PBUH) prayed. If I walk to that place, I can stop there for a while and pray. It's a beautiful place. Right? I think the physical side was the most challenging for me during these Hajj days. And in Madinah, everyone faces the issue of toilets. There are always long queues. Right? Other than that, I don't think there's much of a problem that cannot be tolerated. I hope things have improved in these areas now.\nMuhammad: Okay, brother, in this case, we are thinking about a few things. One big problem for both agencies and pilgrims is that luggage doesn't arrive. Now, since 2024, let me share with you, for example, we brought our luggage with us. You saw that we lifted our luggage and carried it. This time, you won't see your luggage before it arrives at the hotel. In 2022, our luggage was brought by them in bags and given to us at the hotel immediately. But this time, your luggage won't come with you in your car; it will arrive separately like cargo, a separate system for moving passengers and a separate system for moving luggage. This is the Makkah Initiative. It's like, I think in 2020, we handed over our luggage to them for the car. I don't exactly remember what happened.\nMustafiz: We handed it over, yes, we handed it over. They, we went by bus, and they brought our luggage a little while after we reached our hotel, and we took it.\nMuhammad: This time, what actually happens is when you check in your luggage in Dhaka, you will get it directly at the hotel. This is done for the convenience of pilgrims. But the interesting thing here is that if a flight is full with one agency or if there are two agency flights, there's no problem. But if it's fragmented flights, say three people from this agency and four from that, then it's very common for luggage to get lost or go to the wrong place. What we are thinking is that if pilgrims want through an app. Then they can buy a luggage tracker, like a location tracker, which they can use later. And when they put this in their luggage, they can track their luggage's location. First, secondly, this will be beneficial for agencies. They can buy some trackers for their main luggage lots to prevent luggage problems. Also, as you said about the bus issue, it's the same. Just like luggage can be tracked, if agency owners put those trackers in their buses after tracking the luggage, they can then track where their bus is and which route it's taking. This would be a good option for them. And third, and what you'll say, is knowing the various spots for making dua. What happens is when you go to Arafat or Madinah or Makkah, we are thinking of making a map or a list. Here, it will be like a game, a scavenger hunt, showing what objects are where. It will be a gamified object. You can get some benefits if you go to these places and make dua during your Hajj.\nMustafiz: Yes.\nMuhammad: Then the pilgrims can see it. And what happens is people often get confused, \"I came here, what is here? Why is this place famous?\". In that case, there could be some audio-visual cues explaining, \"This place is famous for this reason, the Prophet (PBUH) prayed here, it has this virtue\" with authentic narrations. Similarly, there's a well near Quba Mosque. Have you seen it, where the Prophet (PBUH) was given water from that well when he first came to Quba? Right? They've fenced it off a bit. I probably saw it in 2022 but didn't go inside. It probably costs 12-13 Riyals to enter. It's a small garden within the garden. This time, a colleague of mine went there and said, \"Brother, the tranquility in that garden is immense! He said, 10-12 Riyals is nothing to me. I said I would go inside\". A gentleman was standing there, and he asked, \"Do you know Arabic or Urdu?\". My colleague said, \"I know Urdu.\" Then he explained to him in Urdu that this thing is here, and when the Prophet (PBUH) first came here, he was given water from this well. The well is sealed, but you can take water from there, they give you water if you want. Right? You can take it with you. So, these small places, he said, are very tranquil. That garden is so small, a date palm garden, very tranquil, he said it's very cool. So, if you add such important locations and places of interest in the app. I checked the location, and everyone went in a group. Maybe I'll go there and see it myself. This can be done. Plus, places of interest can be given. Your idea is good. If we do this, do you think there's anything else we can provide to pilgrims?\nMustafiz: One thing is, our pilgrims from Bangladesh take excessive dry food with them. Yes, these are actually... I'm talking about the physical aspect, that it's not really necessary. Allah Himself said there would be no scarcity of food in Makkah. Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) prayed that whoever goes there will find everything. Some poor pilgrims from our country, those with limited income, carry puffed rice, other dry snacks, and make their luggage heavy. I think there's a point here to guide them that it's not needed. All food is available there, no need for puffed rice or to make luggage so heavy. Right? And in Makkah and Madinah, especially regarding transportation, I think this has always been a problem. It probably still exists. You might have gone last in 2023, I don't know if you experienced it then. If there's any opportunity for Bangladeshi agencies to work with agencies or muallems (Hajj guides), they could work on these areas. Another thing, the concept of staying in Aziziyah, that was a good idea by Shepherd, staying in Aziziyah for those few days of Hajj. But a problem is appearing here. For example, in 2022, what we faced was frequent travel and shifting. We stayed in Makkah for seven days first, then went to Aziziyah, then to Madinah, then came back to Aziziyah from Madinah, and then from Aziziyah, we stayed near that place at the end of Ibrahim Khalil Road, what's its name, I forget. This way, we shifted hotels four times. Yes. That's actually a big problem. Dragging and moving so much luggage is very tough. So, the concept of Aziziyah is good. But it should only be for the five days of Hajj. But they kept us in Aziziyah for many days. It felt like more than seven or eight days. Right? So, I think these agencies can do one thing. If Shepherd manages the Aziziyah hotel booking, that booking should be only for those specific days, maybe four days. We don't really stay in Mina for more than three days, maybe four. For these four days, it's just for easy movement to and from Mina. I think Aziziyah can be used for that, but not beyond. But in our case, it was more than seven or eight days, I think, closer to ten days in 2022. Remember, you came directly to Aziziyah with your wife and children from Bangladesh?\nMuhammad: Yes, brother, I remember. Yes. Okay, brother, let me explain a bit about Aziziyah. These packages are called 'shifting packages'. Actually, not just in Bangladesh, agencies in all countries do this to take advantage. In Makkah and Madinah, hotel slots are sold in chunks, and there's no control over it. What happens is that the Saudi hotel owners say, \"I will sell this slot,\" \"I will sell that slot\". So, you have to buy a hotel slot for a specific number of days. It's not like you have the option to take two days more or two days less. This is actually a bit of a problem for agencies.\nMuhammad: Negotiating with hotels becomes your option. Secondly, regarding transportation, what we are thinking is that it's often not possible to have. A complete taxi service there. But perhaps we can help with information, like giving data on what the peak hours are for travel from Makkah to Aziziyah. And other logistical information. We are planning to add some more things here. For example, you said that all food is available there, but when you go for Hajj for 15 or 20 days, it's difficult for you to find.\nMustafiz: Okay.\nMuhammad: That's why some guidance is needed. You want to buy these things, go here; you want to buy those things. What I was trying to say is, if you add that information to the app, like \"I want to buy dates, or jewelry\". Right? These things, or souvenirs, where each one is found. If that information is in your app, then everyone can travel and search for those places themselves and make their purchases. Then the pressure on the agency reduces. Agency staff are often pressured by pilgrims asking, \"Brother, where do I buy dates? Where should I go?\". You'll see many pilgrims asking for guidance, \"Brother, please guide us where to buy, come with me\". If these things are in the app, like \"This thing is available here, this is the best,\" \"This place in the date market,\" or \"If you buy jewelry, buy it in Madinah,\" or \"These places in Madinah are good,\" \"Where to buy good perfume from the perfume market\". If these are located for you, it's the best to do.\nMuhammad: So, brother, we.\nMustafiz: Yes, yes, okay, this is a very good initiative. I think everyone will appreciate it. I definitely do.\nMuhammad: Okay, last question. If all these things are in the app, from your initial perspective, do you think pilgrims would be willing to use it as a paid app, or would it only be useful as a free app?\nMustafiz: Actually, regarding Hajj matters, nobody likes anything paid. I think, in my opinion, everyone expects free service for Hajj matters because it works like Sadaqa Jariya (ongoing charity). Right? Everyone expects that. And if you do it as a paid app, actually, it's not for Bangladeshis. You can impart money for other people from outside Bangladesh, that can be done. But for Bangladeshi pilgrims, it should be free.\nMuhammad: Okay, brother, those were the questions for today. If you have more questions, feel free to call me, no problem.\nMustafiz: No problem, I was just trying to talk to [inaudible] [my sister].\nMuhammad: Okay, then call your sister in the afternoon. She's busy cooking now. She'll pray, then you can talk. Three-thirty, four o'clock in the afternoon would be a good time.\nMustafiz: Okay, Inshallah, stay well then. Assalamu Alaikum."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: This meeting is being recorded. So asalam allayikum uh brother uh thank you very much uh for joining uh with interview. Uh so just to confirm uh you are your age group is between uh 35 to 45 and you are currently a resident of Canada. Is it correct?\nObaid: Country if I'm in I I am of that age group and I submit the group.\nMuhammad: Okay. So first I want to ask you uh can you share uh since uh when you have performed Hajj or Umra um and uh which year was it and how many times?\nObaid: Five times it was it was all last year between the time frame of August of last year till December of last year. I see. And did during back then you used to live in Madina, right?\nObaid: Yes, I was a teacher in Lina. I'll be teacher.\nMuhammad: Okay. So, have any of your Omra trip was um organized and planned by an agency or you like all of them you do it by yourself?\nObaid: Because I was a resident of Medina, alhamdulillah, it was very easy for me and I was able to do them by myself. I was able to arrange transportation and accommodation I use it by myself.\nMuhammad: Okay. So I'd like to know like being a local how would you arrange the transportation and hotels.\nObaid: First and foremost you ask other people who have gone for Umbra themselves who have been residents there or citizens there for a long time. You ask them about the hotels you ask them where have they had good experiences and things like that. And regarding the transportation as well which transport which particular bus stop or which particular taxi stop is good to go to and take the transport from there. So based on you can say peer reviews anybody who has gone there before based on their experience and their suggestions I would go um the I because I was a teacher in Madina I also had co-workers who kind of volunteered with sponsors there are many adult sponsors that go ahead and pay for a certain number of people's Omrah and they pay for transportations and buses and everything. So the people the people who go for Omra the groups they never find out who is the sponsor. They never find out how much it costed them because it is all covered. So I've also gone with my co-workers once in that manner on a big very I would say luxurious bus. The other times I have either driven with a friend of mine or I have even uh how do you say this taken public transport from private rental company that have offered as Bombi.\nMuhammad: Okay. So you you so you most of the time you went with either public transportation or you use sponsored or you sell transportation. Have you ever hire a get a taxi for transportation?\nObaid: Yeah. Yeah. So we used to go to the public taxi spots and we would go and uh by we I mean me and my coworker who want who want to have company with me. So I would go with them to those public stores and I would uh just eat the I just go with them.\nMuhammad: Okay. So lots of the people their main challenge was finding like the right transportation because many of them they feel like the taxi company they do lot their business model is more like extortion. So they understand like the people who come from Omrah or Hajj they are vulnerable. So they ask like very high prices for them. So this is uh according to many of the people who went to Omrah this is true for within the city of Makkah and Medina. and also like intercity travel from Makkai Modina. So what advice would you give people who want to get a taxi or uh travel within the city with the taxi? What advice would you give them uh and how to avoid them or do you also feel the challenge yourself as well?\nObaid: I never found that as a local that is because I had a lot of people that I could ask to how much did they spend on keeps themselves. So whenever somebody was misquing a price but I was asking a bit too much. I automatically knew that wasn't a reasonable price and I knew how much I could bargain it down. So yes, that can happen. I have not seen that to be a rampant uh regularity there that people are being asked too much but it being aware how much it costs. I was always able to bargain down to the right price.\nMuhammad: I see. I see. So you you know the right price so you are able to bargain. So do you think uh in an uh if somebody says I want to go point A to point B and it suggest like a price range right uh then that that would help right\nObaid: yes of course u also if there is an availability I don't know if you have heard of another company but it's it's a really big one from Pennsylvania it's called field nation it's a software service I used to work for them once upon a time they have gained a lot of market in Canada as well when I used to work for them were primarily in the states So what they do is they have people who need work and people who want to work. So technicians and companies that need these techniques. So if it could be an app, there's a platform for not only people like me who are customers to go and find the right price for the right transportation but also there are there's an opportunity for these taxi drivers or public transport companies to post how much they are going to charge for that trip. That would be an amazing platform for people to explore. Yes. Yes. So regarding that I think Uber is some Uber and Kharim is somewhat already doing that in Madina but I'm really surprised uh there is no such things for interc city transport and also I think in Makkah Uber and Karim is not available. So is there any regulation issue you are aware of like why Uber and Kharim is not operable there?\nObaid: I am not aware of any regulation issue but I do understand that Uber and Karim whatever they charge any local company any local taxi driver will charge lessly.\nMuhammad: Okay. So you feel Uber is charging more than what local taxi would have charged right?\nObaid: Yes of course.\nMuhammad: So as a local of Madina would you use Uber for going point A to point B or you also take taxi?\nObaid: As the last resort I always took uh the service of private car owners or taxi drivers.\nMuhammad: Oh okay. And you know\nObaid: by taxi I would never by taxi I don't mean the taxi of Medina the government that is running the taxi not that one there are private companies private private vehicles um they have no markings on them they don't even have a sign that says Uber on them but they always go street to street and they ask people if they can be their chauffeur and their price\nMuhammad: the challenge of reliability comes in right so uh so for for you in a local it's might easier for you to find those things. But people who are uh foreigner in that country who come to Haj and Umrah, how do you think we can ensure like the unmarked taxi vehicle who are not registered uh they cannot use them for their advantage, right? Or like uh don't take them in weird area or something like that. How is there any uh way or or something that you think can help?\nObaid: Well, for for situations like that, there's always an app like Uber or or even taxi. But when it comes to managing your finances and finding a cheaper alternative, yes, if you have uh concern that um these private taxis might not be safe, I don't know if I'm being taken to the right location or not. Any other app, probably an app that new app that can be designed that offers a little bit of reliability like that would certainly be a game changer.\nMuhammad: I see. Makes sense. Makes sense. Uh now it comes to hotel right. Uh one of the biggest complaint um I have seen many Umra pilgrim says is number one when they book a hotel usually they advertise like twostar, three star, fourstar hotel but the quality is not like a threestar hotel like the service is really bad. Uh sometimes they feel like uh like they booked a hotel uh from outside uh the country but when they comes in they says like oh uh there's no reservation. there or the hotel is over booked so hotel already sold there things. Uh I myself felt that once like I booked through Agoda and when I come to the hotel they find my bookings then they says like oh uh you booked it but unfortunately we sold this room for you so we have to move into another room. So it create lots of hassle for foreigner as well. How did you find when you book up accommodation and what suggestion would you give to find like the right accommodation to foreigners who come for Hajanra? foreigners when they come to Amra they do not have the privilege of spending their time walking around and asking uh going door to door of hotels and asking for that's a certainty um in that case the best way that most foreigners seem to operate in Montina they end up going to hotels that have a brand name that have been there for a long time like uh off the top of my head because I thought there I have a student of mine whose father owns Pullman Zam. So everybody knows Pman Zam. It's a renowned hotel. They stay there. Everybody knows. Everybody knows. So people usually to find it safe, they have to spend a lot of money and go to these hotels that are renowned with these booking issues. Even if they have them, they're they're few. They're not major occurrences.\nMuhammad: I see. So like um so so you suggesting like foreigner they should look for like more reliable option instead of shop around and finding thrift option. It is safer to find reliable option here right?\nObaid: Yes.\nMuhammad: Okay. Um there is one thing that's like how many uh agency like they work there is a a pyramid scheme of buying like buying and selling hotel. So usually hotel owner um they sell it to one party and then they sell it to another party then then like by the time like the like the pilgrim they got the hotel it gone through gone through either four or five hands and those the hotel is reliable in that case but the hotel price kind of get increased so in many occasion the price become like 50% more than what the hotel owner get paid uh is there any way like the pilgrim can shorten this uh chain and get like a better deal\nObaid: well Canada and other place so you have some really reliable websites right Booking.com and other websites that are more reliable. Uh if if there was a platform as such where hotel owners directly could come and advertise and people could also find out that okay this is I can I can communicate directly with the hotel owners that would that would certainly reduce the hassle that people will be facing if it's directly in communication with the hotel bookings and everything.\nMuhammad: But does hotel owner uh over they are comfortable selling their hotel in B2C or they want to sell it to someone else who would then then sell the hotel to other people\nObaid: they will go for the they usually go for the uh the shortcut that's available if they see that they can sell B2C they'll go for it if they see that okay we can do it just like realtors work over here in the west put up my listing to the realtor and the realtors end up selling it for me and I get a decent price they will go for that they they're going to be I think of culture they want the least amount of cash\nMuhammad: I see I see so if if a company comes in and they take over that real trucks role they and then I think they can give it into a cheaper price to the people right\nMuhammad: hello can you hear me hello Hello. Okay. So, um in terms of like the regulation, uh so for example, if a foreign company wants to come here and take the realtor's role, do you are you aware of how the regulation works or or do you know someone uh who work in that industry very closely?\nObaid: I am not aware of anybody who works in that industry closely. Unfortunately, one of the main challen Just for me while I was in Ma was how busy my job was. Due to that reason I couldn't really explore these options but u it all has to do with how well communication is between you and whichever part of the government is responsible for this. So the biggest the biggest uh the biggest issue there is language. So there is somebody who is able to communicate and explain the ide to the government official whoever they may be then for sure it is going to pass whatever uh doors and offices that are there. So it's all about explaining to the authorities what it is that wants that needs to be set up. Is it a company? Is it an app? Uh what are the services being offered? And especially uh there is a big how do how do I say this? There's a big u motivation for the Saudi government to work in the tech sector because they want that vision 2030. They're trying to accomplish that because of that reason you it's a good tech idea which can be pitched to them in a manner that is uh not only seems feasible for them but also seems to be beneficial for pilgrims, beneficial for the local population. There is no reason for not jumping.\nMuhammad: I see what you're saying. Um now let's go to the next point. of your Omrah experience like uh how do you so when you you have done Omrah multiple times uh now you don't live in Saudi Arabia however uh but if you want to do Omrah right now would you go through an agency or you do it like a do it yourself like self-guided tool\nObaid: my first preference would always be to to manage it by myself but again uh there are barely any individuals who do not like communities right the entire concepts Walmart and fast food companies has come into existence because we as human beings without convenience. So if an option was given to me that offered me this convenience of being like a one-stop shop where I can go and I can book my ride and book my accommodation I can book my scale and I know when I compare with my local friends and co-workers there that the price that I'm paying is not too different or too high in comparison to me. arranging it all by myself then of course I would convenient with onetop shop\nMuhammad: I see okay make sense makes sense um uh in terms of your Omrah experience like when you first time went to Omrah how prepare you think yourself was and how do you take the preparation for the spiritually like regarding like the dua like the uh like things you need to do and what are the challenge you faced regarding that I did not really face any challenges regarding uh preparing for the own.\nObaid: I I guess the biggest geograph the biggest challenge was the geographical one knowing exactly which door to enter from uh which way to turn which which washrooms are the most convenient to use if you are doing uh s. So it was a geographical challenge rather than uh the ritualistic what it's like what should I do after this? What should I do after that? Because even the Saudi government set up some really nice YouTube pages that highlights these pilgrims. I think was one of the pages that on YouTube would highlight the entire process of the smaller pilgrimage the major pilgrimage very nicely with proper infographics. So it wasn't a ritualistic uh confusion or ritualistic par. It was more of a geographical par. If for example I like to be very prepared. I like riding motorcycles. I like riding bicycles. If I'm going on a trip, it benefits me to know how many kilometers, how many meters, how many hours I'm going to be on the road. So such information from here to here going to be a walk of this many meters. If these information were present, I think not just me, I live there, but anybody else also coming for the first time, they would be able to prepare mentally, you'll be able to prepare physically as well from beforehand.\nMuhammad: I see.\nObaid: These information were very good as well.\nMuhammad: I see. Makes sense. Uh in terms of exploration, right, when you first time went to Makka, uh the very first time and you were uh new there, how difficult was it to like find the right place for shopping, uh find the right place for food? Do you know exactly where to go from your uh local connection or you you have some difficulties then? Because I went with my family and my family consists of my spouse and three children which the youngest was three year old. We did not really have the opportunity or the luxury of walking a lot and speeding out where to go which is the best place to go. So we always ended up choosing whatever option was the closest and was the uh and required the less least amount of effort for us. So in that sense whatever was close to uh We went for that and we automatically found any hotel that was closest to him or that was affordable. Uh but we did not have the opportunity or source of information to know okay this restaurant is this restaurant this cuisine this restaurant offers this cuine so and so that was a big for this information because I will tell you what is the biggest challenges of finding all sadly a linguistic challenge.\nMuhammad: Uh your voice is coming a bit muffled. So if you can maybe clear it up\nObaid: sure the internet connection. What I was saying is one of the biggest challenge Saudi Arabia particularly is a linguistic challenge. So even if you Google information for example which all we are offers the average prices of them you will find a barrier a language barrier that information is presented to you in Arabic. and you're not not all the web of these uh restaurants or hotels offer a transition English or an accurate transmission. So there's business here as well. I think this is a this is a good market to tap into or service to offer um to get an idea to where things generally are, what is closest to them and what are they looking for and what are the average prices of things to eat. Uh shop to go to buy certain certain commodities, certain souvenirs if there was a possibility finding this information particularly in Mish I think we would have benefited more.\nMuhammad: I see. I see. Do you feel the same thing for uh like Zara? So when you for example going to Javalma or Javalur many people they went there by themsel by looking into taking a taxi or Google map. But the sometimes taxi driver they're not able to explain that. So do you think if there is an app when you go into near certain area, it has an audio activated panel that you can listen to and it tell you significance of that area. Do you think something like that would help as well?\nObaid: Oh, that would be amazing. Yes, I'm glad you brought up this topic. So, most people that do and that they're not going through the travel operators or Hajumbla operators, they are left to uh find out the mission. the drivers uh I'm not saying they're less less aware they're very much aware but they will always because they're good people these drivers these uh they tell you that this is what I know this is what I have heard from somebody I cannot guarantee the authenticity of the information but this is what I've heard this is what I know u so there is no authenticity in terms of yes this is what the local government um approves that this is the right information. I'll give you an example of Madina. There was always this well in Madina that people said used to belong to Salman.\nMuhammad: Yes.\nObaid: But still today I have not seen any signage that the government put up affirming this but it's just just hearsay.\nMuhammad: Yes.\nObaid: Yes. I I I exactly understand how I I share my experience as well. I was there is a very famous well um near um uh Majidal Kuba um I I was looking for it but I don't know the exact location or in the map and there is no way I can find it but I saw in YouTube video it's maybe half an hour walking distance from there or maybe half an like 10-minute taxi but because I don't know and I was not able to explain in Arabic to the driver I was not able to go but I really wanted to go because I think this is one of the life well there and like one of the guide there showed me a closed well. So there's there's this place where's like like ring was dropped I like that well was shown to me and there is a marking there only right but I heard there's also a live well uh so I think this gives things value in my opinion and I'm glad that you also agree with that so I think um\nObaid: and uh you also you also mentioned that having uh audios or lectures from uh accredited\nMuhammad: fewers that give an example or that tell you or provide information about certain things that you're going to that is that is an amazing that is going to be a game changer.\nMuhammad: Yeah. So I will we are also um coming to the very last part of the interview. I have two more questions only. First of all uh you come with your family uh so you have young kids there. So share maybe some of the challenge you face uh with your family by yourself uh that you think that you think can be solved using technology right so share some of the uh maybe top five challenges you face and\nObaid: is it is it particularly about uh Haj and Umra or about living in now living there\nMuhammad: no like Haj and Umra and logistics surrounding it\nObaid: um like I said Uber is not a that you can avail in Makkah. You can I I I wasn't able to um I didn't even look at Uber because of the different roads being closed particularly during the times of salah. The roads are closed and at a very large radius. So if you have young children and if you have to walk quite a bit and if you're not mentally prepared for it and if you don't know about it, it's a big challenge. So in that logistics, uh if you are able to know beforehand that these are the short walking paths you can take to go for salah that must haram that would be easy that would be convenient and at the same time uh one of the things that I faced was not knowing the best possible buy things that a family with young children or with children might need. For example, I was really unprepared for my three-year-old and I as unprepared that I didn't have a a satchel to carry him in that the baby car that you can put around your chest you can carry him while doing salaf or anywhere else or doing so I just wanted to buy that from that location I searched in Madina I couldn't find it I had to make the trip I reach Maka I was trying to find it there were many stores there but none of them really had that baby carrier and everybody was pointing towards okay so if you think there's a chance of it then we might only like car and we had to lock quite a lot to go the car for go up escalators and at the end we also have found out that they don't have this. So basic necessities like okay the best place to buy baby food or the best place to buy these these carry off baby wipes to diapers closest to you from this hotel location it's based on that all of these information is highly beneficial in terms of the logistics and if somebody wishes to really this is my opinion if somebody to travel to Makkah and Medina or in between the two cities and they want to travel in a way that doesn't physically tire them and it's not too fatiguing then the my my best recommendation is to use the Saudi government the hypers speed way because it takes you in half the time than a car or a bus. So if somebody put that into their budget that I'm going to go to Madina from Paka I'll take the train or I'm going to go from Madina to from Maka to Madina I'm going to take the train and this is my budget. being aware about the expense of the train service and what benefits it has uh as opposed to no I would like to take multiple stops I need a car. So be able to find both of these options presented to you and being able to make a choice will also help in the logistical situation for people who are going for abroad who do not live there uh that would really benefit them and in terms of food as well. I know different countries, different people have different cuisines and different tastes but sometimes when it's physical journey when it's is grueling to an extent you do not want to consume maybe deep fried foods or foods with a lot of spice and things like that. So knowing or being recommended from the medical professionals, dieticians or people who have gone there before that regardless of which culture you come from or whatever diet you may have these are the foods that you should prefer to consume and these are where you can get them from if you're going to be staying there for a few days or at least you have completed your house or your homework uh that would also be a very nice touch with whatever app or service that can be right\nMuhammad: okay I think thank you very much for this recommendation um in terms of the worship itself Right. When you are doing tawa for sale, do you think like having an offline app where you have all of your duas that you want to make, having all the rituals uh like all the steps, do you think in a in a mobile app uh where all of these things is there would help or you prefer like a pen and pencil uh more like traditional way?\nObaid: 100% not a pen and pencil way. Uh given the Saudi government has paid most things to be used by app right now. To give you an example, the not app itself, people having to make appointments for Omra, for auda visits, all of that is now done through the notebook app. So the shift has already happened to the digital tools other than pen and paper. Um so yes, an app or something digital is is 100% more beneficial, not pen and paper.\nMuhammad: Okay. And after right sometimes People says okay alhamdulillah they did Omrah their spirit was high but when they comes into family they work they kind of lost the spirit. So do you think have like a guided coaching program through a mobile app uh 6 month for 6 month after you perform your umbra or three per month perform your omra to have some solid habit into your life. Do you think that something like that would add values to you?\nObaid: It would certainly add value but uh from my exp in psychology because of being in the training uh people because of customer service training because of teaching I'm a teacher I'm a mentor so I really don't think that is that a six month program like that is going to be by most people rather if somebody who has finished their Omra and they're returning to their home country if they could be reminded through daily or weekly notifications about their experience of their home. It could be given some sort of memory milestones. For example, you're aware about how meta does this. Meta automatically after a year reminds you of pictures that you have posted or taken year back. Even your Android devices and your uh Apple device got a new phone with photos in it. It'll remind you a year later. Oh, this is a throwback to the last year on the same date. These things have a sentimental value. So rather than giving them a program or coaching or a guide for a certain number of months you follow as to how to live your life post um it's it's 100% it's idealistic but people don't live by the ideals neither do I really really easy easy transition if people can be reminded about their experience uh reminded of that they have gone to Seattle visits and you know it has aal reminder emotional uh imp impact on them. So that will fuel them further uh to do a little bit more reading. Maybe we can provide extra articles, maybe align them over certain verses or hadith. Nothing too glory, nothing that requires a lot of commitment off the bat. Something that is based on the sentiment or the emotions of having been there.\nMuhammad: I see. Okay. Makes sense. Makes sense. Uh so for example we have discussed uh lots of the ideas and we brainstorm together like so it so think if so if I say like uh if there's one part of that where you can shop around and buy various things like transportation hotel accommodation that is there on the other hand there's more like a guiding aspect so a digital guide that will tell you where the shops are where the food court are where to go for uh ziara right uh maybe some aspect of how to perform UMRA and all of those things like the guidance part of that. Would you be comfortable paying for an onetime fee for an app? Uh if you get a guidance during Umrah?\nObaid: Yes, of course. It depends on how much it costs. But of course, yes.\nMuhammad: So, how much price you think would be fair uh for this uh kind of app that will give you Omrah and Omrah and during Hajj also Hajj guidance like tell you like some of the places that you can or tell you regarding like the geography and give you some tips and tricks uh regarding logistics and also help you with your um ritual itself remind you what are the right steps to take authentic duas that you need to make and a tool for you how to make duas and stuff uh kind of bigger bigger uh fees so I'm just a teacher I don't earn as much so for me whatever you're asking me might not be high amount, but as it is a bomb and if it is an app that gives me lifetime service and something that it's not going to just cancel or go down and stop updating over the years, but I can use this app again and again to go for my Oprah trips. I would be more than comfortable to spend anywhere between $25 to $50 depending on the range of services it offers.\nMuhammad: I see $25. And if it gives you like one year one year limit, so think of that within one year you can do as much as Omra as you want but it's going to be like a one year's subscription. So for if it ask you only to pay for one year uh and do you think for one year $15 or $20 would be fair or do you think that's too much? Then\nObaid: if it is a oneear subscription fee then certainly I would be okay between the range of uh $10 to $20\nMuhammad: $10 to $20. Okay. Makes sense. Makes sense. Okay. Uh Thank you very much uh brother Oat. It has been really wonderful and insightful talk with you. I'm really grateful uh for your time and hope to speak with you soon. Inshallah whatever endeavors you are jumping on to may Allah give you the also in remember us in your duasam."

    "english_transcript": "Part 1: GMT20250804-121004_Recording.mp3\nMuhammad: I applied, and they told me that as part of this, I need to interview 30 people who are Hajj or Umrah pilgrims or Hajj operators, meaning anyone involved with this course. Also, I felt that since you are from a software background and performed Hajj with your mother last year, Insha'Allah, you can provide some good input. Knowing your perspective adds a lot of value for me. So, based on that, I've scheduled this meeting, and if you don't mind, I'd like to record it. It won't be shared publicly anywhere. Insha'Allah, it might be shared in a closed environment, perhaps with others at Hasan PC's place, for viewing.\nOmar: Yes brother, no problem. I think the recording has already started. I've set it to auto-record, so many things will begin automatically. So, alright brother, let's start.\nMuhammad: To begin with, let's learn a bit about your introduction, as you are sharing your...\nOmar: I am Mohammad Omar Farooq. If my introduction is Hajj-centric, then I would say that last year I went for Hajj with Shephard, taking my mother with me. Professionally, I am a software engineer. My education is in IT; I studied at Triple-E. I've been in software engineering for about three years now. This introduction sounds like a job interview, doesn't it? Fine, Alhamdulillah.\nMuhammad: So brother, you work with technology. Your experience will be relevant for us. So, brother, have you performed Umrah after this Hajj, or had you performed Umrah before Hajj?\nOmar: No, my Hajj was my first. Meaning, going to Makkah and Madinah was my first time. Umrah happened during that Hajj itself. So, that was the first, that was the last. If Allah grants me the opportunity, I will go again.\nMuhammad: So brother, we will divide my interview into four parts, Insha'Allah. First, we will start with your pre-Hajj preparation. How you prepared, what your financial preparation was like, how you chose the agency, what factors were important to you, what challenges you faced, and from these, we will get your opinion on how technology can mitigate these issues. In the second phase, we will analyze the logistical challenges you faced during Hajj, including communication, movement during Hajj, and communicating things in Makkah and Madinah. We'll hear from you about how these were, what challenges you faced, and in your opinion, how technology can solve them. We'll get your opinion on this. The third part will cover rituals. By rituals, I mean performing Umrah, performing Hajj, staying for a long month. During this time, you performed many acts of worship, prayed regularly in Haram Sharif, visited various places for Ziyarah, and did shopping. These were your secular and religious rituals you performed in life. Here, what challenges did you face, and how can technology make your journey beautiful? And lastly, the post-Hajj routine. This is very important for a believer, as Hajj acts as a transformation boot camp, and after Hajj, one becomes a different person. In this case, we won't delve into anything personal. But we'll get your opinion on how we can make this easier purely using technology, and any tips and tricks you can offer that you feel benefited you and could benefit others. Okay, so let's move to the first segment, let's hear the story of how you started your Hajj preparation, what challenges you faced, and how technology can help here. You can include both logistical and spiritual preparation, and also how you chose the agency, Insha'Allah.\nOmar: Yes brother, regarding Hajj, I actually won't be able to utilize the time exactly point by point. You'll have to listen to some extra things, which might be relevant. Hajj became obligatory for me in 2020. When my father passed away, according to Sharia, Hajj immediately became obligatory for me, as my father left some land. So, converting those definitely amounts to the cost of Hajj. At that time, it was the Corona period, Hajj was locked down. Going for Hajj was closed for a long time. In the meantime, I also shifted my career. I quit my previous jobs and became completely 100% unemployed. So, with everything combined, I couldn't perform it in 2020, 2021, or 2022. I couldn't do any Hajj training. And during this time, I was so busy with other matters that I honestly didn't even remember Hajj. This is one point, that I didn't remember. So, in this context, Naim Bhai, one day in 2023, told me, \"Omar Bhai, I think Hajj is obligatory for you.\" I said, \"Yes brother, Hajj is obligatory for me. But the land we have, it's not really sellable. There are no buyers for it. So, that's why I can't go for Hajj.\" Then Naim Bhai told me, \"Brother, make an intention. If you make the intention, it will become easy for you.\" So, here, the common thought about Hajj – our common thought is that if I go for Hajj, I will need 6 lakh taka, or let's say 5 lakh taka. So, we think of a large amount, 'How will I arrange 5 lakh taka when I can't even save 5 taka a month, instead I have debts?' So, then Naim Bhai told me, \"You just do it. If you can go, fine; if not, no problem. Just do a pre-registration. Pre-registration will cost you 23,000 taka or 24, some amount like 300 or something.\" I told Naim Bhai, \"Okay brother, I'll register with 300 taka. It's not a very big amount, I can do it. But what if I register and can't go this year?\" Then he said, \"It's okay if you can't go, you'll go next year. It's not a rule that you have to go if you register. You'll just have a registration number.\" This information really helped me, that 'Okay, I'll pay the money and register then.' When I was about to register, I told my mother. I thought, if I don't take my mother now, she was sick then, I had problems with my feet. I thought, if I don't take my mother, then I will have to...\nOmar: ...go again. Or manage many things again. For women, a Mahram is necessary, and her cost would be double. So I asked my mother, \"Mother, will you go? You have problems with your feet too.\" And my mother said, \"No, if you go, I will definitely go. If you don't take me with you, no one else will. My Hajj won't happen. Somehow or another, I will go. I mean, however you can, arrange the money for me.\" Anyway. After that, my mother also became very firm. Alhamdulillah. Then gradually I saw that yes, it's being managed. I paid the pre-registration money. Then, for the main registration, which costs two to two and a half lakh taka, Alhamdulillah, that was arranged. After that, I was able to sell a piece of land. I mean, it's a process, right? It's not that if I make the intention for Hajj today, I have to go today. I'm getting time to manage the money. So, Alhamdulillah, the money was also managed. An interesting thing here is that my office didn't give me anything, in fact, they cut my salary. But Alhamdulillah, it happened. This was the financial preparation for Hajj. As for physical preparation, many people say, \"Walk two miles, walk three miles.\" Actually, it happens that since I'm going for Hajj, there's a lot of pressure at my job line: \"Brother, have you organized this, organized that? We won't be able to disturb you there.\" And then, my mother is sick. What about my foot problem? In that case, I had cupping (Hijama) done for my mother, telling her, \"Mother, do this Hijama, Insha'Allah, you will stay healthy.\" My mother was also mentally prepared, so Alhamdulillah, Allah made it easy. This was our kind of preparation. And then comes the learning aspect, the preparation of knowledge. What we did in this area, I think there's a lot of scope for technical work, which we might discuss later. So, first we took a session. This session was actually a Tablighi event, and everyone benefited greatly from this session, it was good. But the objective here was to learn Hajj, how Umrah would be performed, how Hajj would be performed. We actually didn't get even 10% benefit. After that, I met Iftekhar Bhai from Chittagong one day. This meeting happened when we were doing medical tests for our Hajj visa. He asked me, \"Omar, will you go to the area tomorrow? Sheikh Ahmadullah will be coming for the Hajj training at As-Sunnah Foundation.\" I said, \"Brother, I don't know about this. What do I need to do?\" He said, \"Register now.\"\nOmar: [ Iftekhar Bhai ] You won't get it later. So, I sat in front of him and registered for both of us, for my mother and for myself. Alhamdulillah, that week we did the training, and it was a very fruitful training. We attended right from the beginning of the morning and stayed until the very end. Alhamdulillah, my mother was also with me. So, I didn't have to train my mother separately. We learned practically, from scholars who regularly go for Hajj; Sheikh Ahmadullah apparently goes for Hajj every year. So, we learned from such scholars. They showed many things through presentations, demonstrating how things are done using maps. This interactive learning was very useful. It was so useful that I didn't have to tell my mother anything there; everything went smoothly. However, there were some issues related to our Mazhab, our Hanafi Mazhab, and the Salafis, there are some differences of opinion, and these had to be managed. We managed them. This was our Hajj preparation. After that, yes, we left a bit early for the flight. If the flight was tomorrow, we arrived in Dhaka today, I mean, the day before the flight. Sorry, the flight was at 7 PM, I think. We landed in Dhaka early that morning. Meaning, we boarded the train at night. We landed early that morning. We stayed at a hotel there. In the afternoon, we entered the Hajj camp. After that, Shephard arranged everything. An important point here is the agency selection. How reliable is the Hajj agency I'm going with? What worked for me here was Naim Bhai. Naim Bhai strongly advised me, \"You can be pretty sure, go under Shephard. I went last time, their everything is good.\" I told Naim Bhai, \"Brother, I don't know Shephard, I know you. You are going with them, if anything happens, you are there, but I don't know.\" Anyway, it's not right to just leave the responsibility to someone like that. I did inquire about Shephard myself. Many gave positive reviews. There is a slight difference between my Masala (rulings) and Shephard's Fiqh (jurisprudence). But I had to manage this myself. And the agency's main job is not to provide Fiqh or Masala, or to make you perform the rituals. The agency provides logistical support, your traveling, your hotel stay, your food, your time management, these things.\nMuhammad: Yes brother. To summarize, your journey was Masha'Allah very smooth. I understand you had some challenges, some financial uncertainty. Then there was the issue of agency selection, where you relied on Naim Bhai. And there was some knowledge needed for your spiritual preparation. So, do you think if this could be brought into a mobile app, where you could take pre-recorded courses from renowned scholars, and then when you sign up, you could see verified, unbiased real reviews of agencies from those who have performed Hajj before? And also, from the moment you register until your Hajj, if you were given a financial plan, like how much to save each month, how to budget—if such a tool were provided, would you use it, and would you consider it adding so much value that you would pay to use it?\nOmar: Okay, personally, I personally would not go for an app [to pay money to the app directly]. If you develop an app, you'll find many types of users, no doubt about that. But personally, what I'm saying is, I would never pay money to the app directly. Because...\nMuhammad: You won't pay money to the app. You'll pay the agency. But there will be a small subscription fee for the app, which helps you with these things.\nOmar: Ah, I see. If you directly ask me what technical things can be done, instead of dividing it into segments as you did, if you told me, \"Brother, we are building an app for Hajj. What features would you suggest?\" Then I could say a lot of things. Because after returning from Hajj, I also took the initiative to make an app. I didn't find a partner. Then I heard that you bosses are building an app. Rana Shakur Bhai is also apparently building an app. Hearing that, I didn't proceed further. What would I do? So, I thought of quite a few features myself. If you let me speak freely instead of keeping me within these segments, then I can tell you.\nMuhammad: Okay, you tell us.\nOmar: Here's what I think: the main feature I wanted for the app I planned to develop was notifications. That is, users should receive notifications about Hajj events. My plan for the first feature of my app was like this: for example, if I said that government pre-registration has started and there are four days left, the agency wouldn't have to separately tell people in WhatsApp groups. My app's plan was that agencies would subscribe to it, and all common notifications would go to all users. For example, if you, Shephard, subscribe to my platform, and then you add all your pilgrims—20-25, 40, 100, 200 people—and they all install the app on their phones. Now, your... what should I call it? Your announcement, you would give it within the app itself. The announcement would go to the users. And common announcements, like pre-registration has started, pre-registration will end, flights will begin from such-and-such date—these common notifications or announcements would be handled by the platform itself. And for agency-specific announcements, for example, \"Omar Farooq, your flight is on the 23rd,\" the agency would perhaps give this notification in their panel, and it would go to the specific user. Those that are for all users would go to all users. Those that are for specific users would go to specific users. This was one such feature I wanted to implement. Meaning, pilgrims should be aware of all events, that these things are happening, these matters are ahead of me. I wanted to keep this in the features. Another thing I wanted to include was a checklist. A pilgrim has a checklist from Bangladesh until boarding the plane. The checklist would include managing money, pre-registration done, visa obtained. These checklist items would update automatically. Meaning, the user would know that out of 50 checklist items, 20 are done and 30 are still remaining. And there would be tooltips or guidance on how to complete them, or links would be provided, like \"How do you prepare for this?\" Inside, there could also be Hajj preparation, meaning knowledge preparation, like how to perform the rituals, how to wear Ihram, how to perform Tawaf—these things would be in the checklist with links. So, one by one, for example, whether your English learning is done, there would be quizzes inside. Then, whether you've bought Umrah clothes—all kinds of small and large details, I had a plan to include in the checklist.\nMuhammad: One moment, brother... Sorry to interrupt. Hello, can you hear me? Yes, brother, please continue. What else?\nOmar: Next, that was the checklist, that's one feature. Another plan I had was, suppose you are now in Saudi Arabia, you performed Umrah. When you're performing Umrah, my plan was to have a list of its procedures. And the user would mark them as 'done' one by one, checking them off. For example, first, they need to wear Ihram. Then, after wearing Ihram, they will make the intention. Then, they need to perform Tawaf. They need to pray two rak'ahs of Salah. Then, they need to perform Sa'i. This sequence, this order, they would find it in the app. And by following the app's instructions, their Hajj would be complete. They wouldn't have to follow any Muallim (religious guide). The app itself would become their Muallim, a digital Muallim. Because sometimes when we're performing Umrah, we forget things, we get lost. These kinds of problems wouldn't happen anymore. They would get instructions from the app. And here I wanted to include another feature, which is emergency support. This, of course, goes a bit from digital to offline. There would be a... what should I say? If I had that kind of capacity, I would have a team that would always receive calls. If someone calls and says, \"Brother, I forgot this ritual,\" or \"Brother, I did this action, please give me a suggestion now,\" they would get a suggestion instantly. For example, someone forgot to pray two rak'ahs after Tawaf and went for Sa'i. What should they do now? I wanted to provide such a solution here. That was the checklist. Then, regarding...\nMuhammad: Let me interrupt here for a moment. You mentioned this digital Muallim, the support. We often do this by searching on Google, like \"dot.com dot.com\" (websites) for Hajj information. Now, there's AI. We can get suggestions much more easily with AI. For example, if I tell you, a technical person, that if you use context engineering with AI, then you can see the correct AI stating what's mentioned in which verse or Hadith, and the AI can speak with references. Now, if it's like this, trivial things are directly suggested by AI, but then there's an option: if you want to know more, then you consult a Mufti. If there's a complicated question, like you might have been 10 minutes short of half the night in Mina, but there was a reason—AI can't solve this. For such complicated questions, it would directly tell you, \"This is beyond my capacity, you need to talk to a scholar.\" Would you prefer this, or directly recording a scholar?\nOmar: Okay brother, here I am talking about features. The problem's solution can be achieved in many ways. I am not in favor of AI, not in favor of AI for the reason that if I ask a question to AI, it will ask me which fiqh I follow or which school of thought I follow. There are many such issues. Now, for example, if I call, and they know I'm from Bangladesh, they will mostly assume that I'm either Hanafi or Ahle Hadith from Bangladesh. They can sort it out that way. But if you give an AI, it will take a long time for it to determine the fiqh. Anyway, I haven't thought too much about this. I was focused on the features, not how to solve these things. And another thing is that these things are fixed, for example, if I'm going through a checklist item by item. AI is not needed for this. I first performed Tawaf, then prayed, then went for Sa'i, then cut my hair. These things have been fixed for ages. AI would be needed when something goes wrong. And if AI makes a mistake when something goes wrong, then you really don't have a chance to correct it. In that case, I think it's better to go directly to a scholar. Anyway, this is a topic that requires discussion. Okay, after this, this feature was in my mind. Another feature I had in mind was location tracking. For example, if you, the agency, Shephard, have 400 pilgrims. You can track the exact location of each and every pilgrim if they have that app installed. I wanted to provide this feature. And for example, if you say, \"Brother, I'm lost.\" Then you just click a button there saying \"I am Lost.\" When you click it, an alarm or notification will go to your agency. Then your agency can find you, that our Omar Bhai is at such-and-such place. Someone can go and bring him. Or sometimes it happens that 10 pilgrims have completed our rituals. We want to go to the hotel together. Then I would see the location of those 10 pilgrims, that one pilgrim is here, another pilgrim is there. Or which pilgrim is close to me. I could contact them. I wanted to make a feature like this with exact pin-point location, showing how many feet or meters away someone is from me. I haven't seen how much of this can be done on Google, I mean, it's just about pin-pointing locations specifically based on the Haram area. This was one of my desires. These are the features that come to my mind now.\nMuhammad: Let me give you a thought here. Do you remember when we were in Medina and we were going for Ziyarah by bus, there was a mix-up regarding your mother's seating on the bus? Some communication... communication, that's actually a common problem. Agencies currently do it through WhatsApp. Many agencies don't even use WhatsApp. What they do is just give a briefing, \"Today's week will be like this.\" Many agencies have a ritual: \"Every day after prayer, you'll come to the dining area at this time for dinner. During dinner, we'll have a five-minute briefing at the dinner table. Then you go to your room.\" So, what do you think can be done here, and how can technology solve this? Do you think current methods are effective, or is there room for innovation here?\nOmar: No, what's currently there is absolutely not effective. I already told you that I want every pilgrim to be aware of every event. That is my feature. The first feature is that they will receive notifications about everything. Now, for example, if I give a voice recording, I say something, and each person will interpret its meaning in their own way. Some will listen, some won't. Some can understand, some can't, and so on, many kinds of problems. To keep everyone aware of every event, I wanted to include that feature, meaning notifications would go out. For example, regarding the bus issue, which bus number someone will board. It would be specifically stated there. Also, regarding food and drink, what time it will be served, and how it will be given to whom. For instance, I had a problem when I landed in Makkah. I kept asking, \"Brother, how many days will we stay here, how many days in Madinah?\" Shephard was not telling me this. If I didn't know the duration, I couldn't figure out if I was a Muqim (resident) or a Musafir (traveler). Because I follow the Hanafi Mazhab, but Shephard follows a different Fiqh. That's where the problem arose. I saw that Shephard wasn't giving it importance. Later, I think I even performed Qasr (shortened) prayers. After that, I learned the actual duration, that we would become Muqim, I think we stayed for about 16 days. These kinds of confusions wouldn't happen if I had it in an app beforehand, if an app was used, and if my plans were already in the app. At least if I couldn't say the exact dates, I would have an estimate. I could give a tentative date, that we might go on such and such date. These kinds of things happen. And brother, you've taken me back...\nMuhammad: Do you remember in 20 [best guess: 2000] when it was challenging to go from Muzdalifah to Jamarat to stone, and there were many elderly people who found it difficult?\nMuhammad: And another day, in many cases, your groups were working with men, and your mother's group was working with women. I remember my aunt was in your mother's room, and they were together. And my uncle was in your room, and you all were together. In these situations, you faced many challenges during the Hajj days. You were fine, but logistically, the difficulties for the elderly, the crowds, getting lost, and other problems that occur – how do you think these can be solved technically?\nOmar: Okay brother, for these, I don't think there's any technical solution. Many parameters work here. Firstly, whether that thing is available to me, whether I can avail it, whether the government is providing it. Things change every year in various ways. I don't think we can do anything with an app here. Primarily, information can be streamed more efficiently.\nMuhammad: It can be. Do you remember when events were happening, you were continuously given guidelines: \"Do it this way, don't do it that way\"? And this year, for example, they had various forums, groups. So now, if there's any cloud-sourced intelligence, where all pilgrims using your app are talking to each other, communicating with each other, sharing real-time feedback—do you think this cloud-sourced intelligence would be beneficial?\nOmar: Brother, please say it again, cloud...\nMuhammad: Cloud-sourced intelligence. To know how crowded the Haram is now, where roads are closed. You can ask questions in the group, your question is picked up, answered. Don't you think it's important that if we categorize a few features, like what the traffic is like, how many people are in Mataf now, how many people are in Masa'a—if various users report these categorized things, like \"Yes, there are more people in Mataf now, more traffic on the road now, Masa'a is very crowded now,\" then it would definitely be good because people are getting real-time updates and can go out according to their convenience. The second thing I want to say is, we need to make a lot of Du'a, and there's a success to Du'a. Yes, we need to make Du'a for ourselves and our families. Pilgrims often say, \"Okay, go to the plain of Arafah and make Du'a for an hour.\" There are some Du'as to make. So, what if there was a conversational AI chatbot that might ask you some questions, remind you of your inquiries? Like it could say, \"Okay, what do you want for your well-being? What do you want from your soul? Where do you want to see your son? How do you want to see your life? What are your life goals?\" Here are various questions that are common Du'as...\nOmar: I don't really know who your target users are. So, I don't think Bangladeshis would take so much trouble, regarding these Du'a matters, they won't spend so much time on their mobiles. If your target users are Bengalis, especially Bangladeshis, I don't think this would be very... appealing to the user. However, what could happen is, you could, what you can do in the app is, after giving an announcement to a user, you can take their feedback on it. Taking feedback with every announcement, this can happen. Just like on various websites, they take feedback, for example, in the case of a license agreement, they take feedback like, \"I have read this, I have read all of it, and I agree with this,\" such things can happen. For example, in many places, unless you scroll to the end, that button doesn't become active. So, what happens is, the things we absolutely want to inform the user about, we can take feedback in that way, that the user must take this action, then they will be forced to be aware of it. Such...\nMuhammad: Let me interrupt for a moment. When you were making Du'a in the plain of Arafah, do you think you were able to make Du'a effectively, and what methods did you adopt to do so?\nOmar: Alhamdulillah, I was actually able to. What I adopted was that I actually went out of the tent and found a secluded place outside. Where there's actually no secluded place in the plain of Arafah, where no one knew me. I went to a place like that, and then I didn't have any problem with that wholehearted, as you said, 'praying with a full heart.'\nMuhammad: And did you write down your Du'as anywhere?\nOmar: No, I didn't write them down. I didn't write them down, but I had them in my memory. I mean, we went during the early days of Hajj. We had a lot of time. So, we used to perform Tawaf. We used to make Du'a during Tawaf. Then, we used to make Du'a after the Tawaf prayer. So, for these, I generally had a practice of what I want, what I need now. So, at the plain of Arafah, I didn't have that problem of what things I need to include or say in my Du'a. And I had Hisnul Muslim on my mobile. So, I tried to recite mostly generic Du'as that came from the Quran and Hadith. After that, I also made specific Du'as for myself.\nOmar: Actually, this is about your spiritual matter. Here, an app would interrupt you. Actually, an app cannot help you here. I think that when it comes to acts of worship, involving an app here would cause more interruption.\nMuhammad: Okay, what we are planning, you talked about text and prayer, in this case, we are planning to put your app in a complete 'Do Not Disturb' mode for prayers. So, when you turn on the prayer feature, your mobile notification will come or perhaps...\nOmar: No, I'm not calling calls and such an interruption. The app itself is an interruption. If you're looking at your mobile, your connection with Allah will never truly be there. That's what I personally feel. When I'm raising my hands and making Du'a, I'm lost in it. There's no app or anything there. That's when I'm completely in a relaxed mode, 100% relaxed. That's when my true Du'a will come from within. If I'm looking at a mobile and it's instructing me, I think that itself is an interruption.\nMuhammad: Okay, brother, it's given, so I'll join the rest of the session later. Let's end here for now. We'll join again using the same link after prayers, Insha'Allah. Okay.\nPart 2: GMT20250804-132822_Recording.mp3\nMuhammad: You were saying that having Du'a in the app creates a bit of a distraction. Right? Alhamdulillah, brother, that's actually a good point you shared. So, let's move on to the next year. Do you remember when we went for various Ziyarats? We went to Ta'if. Then we went to see a museum in Madinah. Then in Madinah, we went for Ziyarat in multiple buses. Then in Makkah, you went to Jabal an-Nur, then Jabal Hira, Jabal Rahmah, then the plain of Arafat, and we did some more Ziyarats. And what was happening there was that the agency staff, Tareq Bhai mainly, was sharing the significance of the place using a microphone, or the Sheikh was giving discourses using a microphone. And I don't know if you went to Ta'if, or if for Ta'if, they sent recorded audio for the discourse. So, in this case, what we're thinking is, if I include a feature in the app you mentioned, a location-specific overview. So, when you go to any location, you can hear what the significance of that location is and why it's famous. And since pilgrims stay for a month during Hajj, if someone wants, registered taxis will be available, and they can select trips location-wise. They will take you on trips there, and you can also do self-guided tours. Do you think this would add value to your app? The one you were planning...\nOmar: If it came to features for my app, I wouldn't add this. I wouldn't add it because it doesn't align with the purpose of this app. I mean, it's going in another direction. For example, you would be providing a service, as you said, if I understand correctly, a car service, right?\nMuhammad: Users can book.\nOmar: So, I feel that this is actually taking us away from our core focus, the focus of Hajj.\nMuhammad: It's leaning towards logistics, right?\nOmar: It's going towards that. It's not even core Hajj related. It seems like it would require a separate management for this. If you personally ask about my app, I would focus on my main work. Maybe I would release a separate app for this. But if you say this is a Hajj app, then I wouldn't include this in it.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, in that case, you wouldn't do that. Suppose your app doesn't have such things. But what kind of things could it have? For example, when you go to a location, would you add authentic narrations about why that location is famous? For instance, there are many fables about many locations that are not properly documented, not even authentic narrations found among Muslim historians. There are many such places in Ta'if. But there are also some places that are authentically narrated, like the cave of Mount Hira, but the actual story might have fables attached. When you go to a place, what is the actual story? Would you add that history to the app? That can be done. This feature isn't separate for you. It's just information. You add some videos or some audios. For example, when someone is at that exact point, say, when you stand in front of the Kaaba, it will track that. Then it would automatically play a video of, say, 10-12 lines about the Kaaba. That could be, for example, Sheikh Ahmadullah describing the Kaaba. Yes, that could happen. Or one of our Sheikhs narrating the event of Ta'if, and it automatically plays there. This could happen, or text could appear, that's also possible.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's talk about the last thing. We've covered quite a few things, Masha'Allah. To get to the essence, regarding life after Hajj, do you think a mobile app or an organized training program or a life lesson-related program can help in any way?\nOmar: It's actually a bit difficult to say. Because I haven't really thought about it. After Hajj, how an app could support pilgrims or provide various services even after Hajj. How that could happen, I haven't really...\nMuhammad: Let me share something with you, just as a discussion.\nOmar: Yes, brother.\nMuhammad: For example, you've performed Hajj, right? So, after performing Hajj, people want their lives to continue with a focus. After Hajj, the spiritual quality of life is expected to upgrade. For example, maybe you used to pray five times a day regularly in the mosque, but now you've decided, \"Okay, I will focus on praying in the front rows,\" because you tried to pray in the front rows in Haram, and now you want to continue that. But it might happen that in your worldly life, you forget about it. So, some reminders of this kind. Then, for example, a monthly check-in session. In the check-in session, a monthly reminder for those you went to Hajj with, or those who went to Hajj at the same time as you, about what we are doing together after Hajj. In that case, some scholars could give lectures on how to maintain the spirit of Hajj, and a social support group. For example, when you went for Hajj, you had collaboration and communication with those who went with you, like a social network where you share what tasks you are doing, supporting each other in good deeds. Is something like this possible, or...?\nMuhammad: What do you think? Or would this also shift the app's focus? Would it become...\nOmar: Exactly, that's what I'm trying to say. When I've finished Hajj and come back, as a Muslim, a servant of Allah, of course, I need to increase my good deeds. But the fact that I need to increase my good deeds or improve myself is not exactly tied to Hajj anymore. What happened is, this is something that even someone who hasn't performed Hajj should do. I feel like this falls into another category. In that case, maybe I can add him to another activity, saying, \"Brother, stay with these people, or stay with this group, then your improvement will happen.\" But just because you performed Hajj, these things should be done, or because you performed Hajj with us, we are advising you—this doesn't seem relevant here anymore. That's what I think, I might be wrong. You might be able to say it better. But as a user, if I use the app, I would feel that I have performed Hajj and come back. I don't need this app anymore.\nMuhammad: I understand. Makes sense. Okay, now, regarding what you said about logistics, like taxis or such things, a separate logistics app could be considered. Now, Omar Bhai, let me share something with you. You are planning to go for Umrah, Insha'Allah, maybe you'll go soon. Now, since you've already performed Hajj, will you go for Umrah through an agency, or do you plan to manage everything yourself based on your experience?\nOmar: You might be thinking this is somewhat like the current travel apps, where, say, I want to go to Thailand, and I book everything from here, flights, tours, everything. Yes, there are such users. There are such users. However, if I personally go alone, then I would use such an app. But if I go with family, then I would actually go with an agency. If it's a hybrid system where you can see various agency trips and also customize it yourself, that's possible. I mean, there are many people who prefer to go by themselves, for example, Sohel Bhai, who was in our room...\nOmar: Sohel Bhai is that type of person who manages everything himself, he doesn't accept interference from anyone. But for me, it's like, \"Brother, I'll pay the agency. Let the agency worry as much as they need to worry. I'll follow them. I don't want to deal with so much hassle now. Even if it costs me 20,000 taka extra.\" That's how I feel, I don't want to take on that trouble.\nMuhammad: Okay, Omar Bhai, tell me something. Often, the biggest problem we face here is selecting an agency. For example, you got information about an agency from Naim Bhai, that's fine. But suppose when you go to perform Umrah, you find that Shephard doesn't have a suitable package, and this is not just your experience. You'll see many pilgrims asking in forums, \"What's a good group for Umrah?\" Then they ask, \"Go to this person, go to that person.\" If we bring this into an app, let's say you performed Hajj with Shephard. You would give a verified review in that app, with some proof that you were with them, saying, \"Yes, I worked with them. I liked these things about them, I benefited from these features.\" An honest review, a verified review, and you would give a score like on Uber. If you see that every agency has this, and reviews are accumulating, public and private. So, it's not that you have to use the app, but anyone who went with that agency and can show some Hajj verification document can give a review. And you saw that every agency is accumulating reviews. Based on this, would you actually feel comfortable with this, or would you still prefer a referral from someone you know?\nOmar: Okay brother, you've asked a very pointed question. Personally, I would not go for such reviews. Because the reviews people give are entirely emotional. Consider, there are many issues. For example, all 400 pilgrims who performed Hajj with Shephard. I've become very good friends with you. I wouldn't want to give you a one-star rating now. Or sometimes, there's a minor problem. Maybe it's not even the agency's fault, but it happened because of bad luck. Everyone will just give them one star. Sometimes, I don't find the reviews fair. That's why, personally, I used to look at reviews on Facebook or various pages once upon a time. Now I don't look at reviews. Because reviews can be manipulated. And another thing is that it's an emotional matter. Users give ratings for different reasons at different times. Perhaps I understand this internally. That's why I might not prefer it. I think many people choose this way, by looking at ratings. Otherwise, ratings wouldn't be so popular.\nMuhammad: I understand. The model you're suggesting is based on people you know. Is that scalable, in your opinion? For instance, the problem agencies face, let me tell you, agencies say that they had, say, 100 pilgrims in a year. Next year 100, the year after that 100, making it 200. Every year their number of pilgrims increases, referral numbers increase, but this growth is very slow. Sometimes, those who want to provide good service cannot really scale their business, they reach a plateau.\nMuhammad: In this case, what do you think agencies can do so that pilgrims trust them, that 'yes, if this agency does this, I will trust that they are a genuine agency and will provide good service'? What can be done in this regard?\nOmar: In this case, what happens, for example, if I speak practically – one is the solution, and another is what to do now? What is being done now, for example, how do we know Shephard as a good agency? I learned from Naim Bhai that Shephard is good. Another person learned that Opu Bhai went with Shephard. Another learned that Asifishidat Bhai was there. So, when popular figures say, \"Yes, I blindly recommend Shephard,\" then everyone understands that yes, Shephard is good. So, it comes down to celebrities saying that this agency is good, then people might believe that yes, the agency is good. It's useless even if the Imam of the mosque says so. Because it is often seen that after listening to the Imam of the mosque, even if someone goes with an agency, they face a lot of trouble during Hajj. This is happening quite often.\nMuhammad: So, influence marketing plays a role here. I'll ask one last question. Now, for Umrah, it's not much of a hassle. In Hajj, you have to read many things. For Umrah, it's very simple. Hmm. Your flight, your transportation, your hotel, your food, those are fine. Now, if an agency shows you proof, for example, they gave you your flight PNR number so you can check your flight ticket online. And if you want to change your flight or something, they give you sufficient support, as much as possible. The second option is for hotels. For hotels, your hotel has a BR number, a booking registration number. And now the Saudi government is streamlining things further through [best guess: Nusuk]. They gave you the BR number for your hotel booking. If you want to go from Makkah to Jeddah to Makkah, or from Makkah to Madinah, they gave you a train ticket or booked a bus for you and gave you the document, including the bus driver's phone number. If they satisfy you by providing documents, do you think an agency can do this, or is referral still a very important factor? In this case, this is a hypothetical scenario for you. Like, you mean that a new agency came, and all their documents are clear, transparent, they're doing everything. Now, would I go to that agency?\nOmar: No, I would still prefer Shephard.\nMuhammad: Let me give you a real hypothesis according to what you said. Suppose Shephard is now a superior agency, and there's another agency you don't know. Both offer you the same hotel, same type of transport, same plane, same class airfare. And both agencies tell you, \"I will give you BNR, booking registration, everything.\" But Shephard's cost is 10,000 taka more than the other agency. And two of you are going, so you'll have to pay 2,000 taka extra for two people. Would you still choose Shephard, or would you choose the other agency that gives you verified service?\nOmar: Okay, if it were that I had never done Hajj and didn't know Shephard...\nMuhammad: In that case, you have performed Hajj, and now you are going for Umrah. In that case, you know Shephard, you know they are good, but they are charging 10,000 taka more. But another agency will have everything okay on paper, and you just need to trust their documents. Would you be comfortable with that?\nOmar: Personally, since I know Shephard, I'll go with Shephard.\nMuhammad: I understand. No, my answer is straightforward. I can't give you any logical background for this. I mean, I would feel, if they take 10,000 taka more, let them take it, I'm going safe, that's what it is.\nMuhammad: Trust is very important to you, right?\nOmar: Yes, trust is important. I went with them, they know me, I know them. I don't want to get introduced to new people now and be in tension whether they are actually good or not, what happens mid-way, whether they will support me or not. I don't want to take these hassles now. Now, brother, take 10,000 taka extra, let me perform my rituals peacefully. That's what I want now.\nMuhammad: Alright brother, these were mainly my questions for today. Alhamdulillah, your suggestions were very beneficial. We will consider adding what you mentioned to our app. I will conclude. First of all, do you have any other suggestions? And if not, if I build your app and want to sell it to you, how much would you pay for it, or would you only use it if it's free? Tell me about this amount. As a user.\nOmar: Hmm.\nOmar: Okay, first of all, I won't pay any money. Bangladeshi people don't pay to use apps yet. So, the model I'm thinking of is that I will take money from the agencies. And if an agency manages 500 pilgrims through this app, I will take a subscription fee from them based on that.\nMuhammad: And if the agency takes this money from the pilgrims and informs them, then if you go through Shephard, and Shephard tells you, \"Okay, we will give you access to this app, but it's an optional add-on.\" Would you then buy it as an optional add-on if the agency recommends it to you?\nOmar: Yes, I would buy it as an optional add-on if I know that these features are available there. I will receive all notifications, if I get lost, they can track me, I will get emergency support. Then I will definitely pay the agency's fee if needed.\nMuhammad: Here, you prefer the agency's referral, right?\nOmar: Yes. If the agency is involved with the app and the agency takes responsibility for it, then I will use it.\nMuhammad: Perfect, perfect. Okay, in that case, what would you consider a fair price for the agency to charge you for this?\nOmar: Difficult question, brother. As a user, I would want that if I use this app for the entire 40 days of my Hajj, I would be willing to pay up to 2000 taka.\nMuhammad: 2000 taka. That's good. Masha'Allah. Okay, expecting 1500, but a very good number.\nOmar: No, I will give up to 2000. Because if I perform Hajj for 4 lakh, 5 lakh taka, then 2000 taka doesn't seem like too much for my Hajj to be smooth.\nMuhammad: Now, this psychology won't work for everyone, of course. Many wouldn't agree to pay even 200 taka. Bangladeshi people, I don't think they want to spend that much money on apps yet. Makes sense, makes sense. Okay brother, thank you very much for your time. Thank you so much. You gave me your time twice, I'm really grateful. Omar Bhai, may Allah bless you, Insha'Allah.\nMuhammad: And please pray for me. I am trying to do something beneficial. And the app you mentioned, Alhamdulillah, we have developed an app that is exactly 90% similar. It's on the app store, its name is Qanin (Q-A-N-I-T-Double E-N). Insha'Allah, take a look and give some feedback.\nOmar: Brother, please spell out the name for me.\nMuhammad: Yes, Insha'Allah, I'm giving it to you. We've covered the ritual part, Insha'Allah. We will improve it further, Insha'Allah.\nOmar: Okay brother. I also enjoyed it. Because I also had a dream to build something like this.\nMuhammad: Hopefully, Insha'Allah. May Allah grant you the opportunity to perform Umrah very soon, and I hope you will be one of our paid subscribers, Insha'Allah.\nOmar: Why, brother? After giving an interview for so long, do I have to become a paid subscriber?\nMuhammad: Okay. For you, there will be a 100% discount, Insha'Allah. No problem...\nOmar: Insha'Allah. Bangladeshis don't spend money on apps, brother. You will be a paid subscriber, but there will be a promo code for your discount. No problem. Peace be upon you, brother."

    "english_transcript": "[00:00] Muhammad: The meeting is being recorded. Brother, the words are breaking up a bit, could you please speak clearly?\n[00:03] Reza: Yes, yes, okay brother, yes, speak.\n[00:05] Muhammad: Okay, then Inshallah, let's start the interview, Inshallah.\n[00:09] Muhammad: Okay brother, if you could formally introduce yourself at the beginning and share, Inshallah, which year you performed Hajj and how many times you performed Umrah before, please share that, Inshallah.\n[00:21] Reza: My Hajj is for the first time this year, with Shepherd Shepherd. I performed Umrah probably in 2021. Oh, in 2021, right?\n[00:29] Muhammad: Yes.\n[00:30] Muhammad: Okay, okay. I understand. So brother, when you performed your Hajj and Umrah? Your Hajj was a very guided trip. Was your Umrah self-guided? Or did you go for Umrah with an agency too?\n[00:39] Reza: No, I went for Umrah alone.\n[00:41] Muhammad: Okay, okay, when you went alone, how did you book hotels and transportation? From here, for example, before going online, did you perhaps book hotels through Hotel.com or Expedia, probably through these?\n[00:58] Reza: Hmm.\n[00:59] Reza: And hmm.\n[01:00] Reza: And what about your car, I mean transportation, I took taxis there, and my hotel was about 12 minutes, like 15 minutes walking distance from Haramain, so I didn't need a car much. But if I needed a taxi, I'd just stand on the street normally and get a taxi that way...\n[01:17] Muhammad: I see. So when you booked your hotel through, I mean, through Booking.com or Expedia.com, did you face any challenges, or was the process very smooth?\n[01:29] Reza: It was smooth. Just hotel apps are for hotels...\n[01:32] Reza: Apps are actually specialized for booking hotels. So, Alhamdulillah, I didn't face any challenges. Just like normal...\n[01:38] Muhammad: Regarding pricing, did you feel that you shopped around for the pricing usually offered by agencies, or did you directly go and book the hotel on Expedia?\n[01:47] Reza: Actually, during Umrah, I didn't have any agency connection with me in Canada. I went directly. So I didn't go through any agency. Therefore, I didn't have the opportunity to understand price reductions [I understand].\n[01:54] Muhammad: When you say you booked the taxis yourself, did you face any challenges with taxis, like did you feel that taxi drivers were unfair or trying to scam you in some cases? Did you face anything like that?\n[02:07] Reza: Brother, what happened first was that when we went for Umrah in 2021, the plane landed at the new airport. I had taken information from here that there would be money exchangers and phone cards (SIMs) available right after landing at the airport. But what happened was that the new airport had just opened then. It wasn't fully established yet. So, when I landed there, there weren't many taxis or taxi drivers. And those taxi drivers don't speak English. Because of that, I faced some challenges there. But Alhamdulillah, later I was able to catch a taxi at the designated spot. So there, yes, due to the language barrier, booking a taxi was only a challenge initially, when going from Jeddah to the hotel. To Mecca. That time. And the rest of the time, I got taxis by just standing on the street. And they already know, if you say Haramain, they take you. And another thing that happened was that I got acquainted with a Bangladeshi taxi driver there. So, when returning, I had told them. And they came. They picked me up from the hotel and took me to Jeddah airport.\n[03:00] Reza: So mainly, the problem with dealing with taxi drivers there is the language barrier.\n[03:04] Muhammad: Okay. You had an advantage that you luckily got acquainted with a driver who could speak your language. So you didn't face that challenge anymore, and Alhamdulillah, the person you got acquainted with was reliable and gave you good service.\n[03:19] Reza: Yes, yes, I don't have many taxi-related challenges. I didn't have such an experience, Alhamdulillah.\n[03:22] Muhammad: Did you travel from Mecca to Medina?\n[03:24] Reza: Yes, oh, okay, yes, I travelled from Mecca to Medina. There was a bus depot, a bus station, about 10-15 minutes walk from my hotel. So, from there, I just walked. I went and bought a ticket from the bus station. And then, with my family, I just got on the bus. And then, when I got off at the bus stand in Medina, there are always taxis there, so I took a taxi from there to the hotel.\n[03:52] Muhammad: I understand.\n[03:53] Muhammad: Okay, your hotel was 12 minutes walking distance from Haram, right?\n[03:57] Reza: 15 minutes, 12-15 minutes, something like that, yes.\n[04:00] Muhammad: Did that make a difference for you, or do you think you could have taken something a bit further away for less cost, or perhaps closer?\n[04:08] Reza: No, since it was walking distance, I didn't have to take a taxi, and the hotel fare seemed reasonable to me. Although the hotel wasn't anything high-fi. But 15 minutes walk within walking distance isn't much. So the price I got for a walking distance hotel was Alhamdulillah reasonable to me.\n[04:36] Muhammad: Which hotel was it?\n[04:38] Reza: I don't remember the hotel name from 2021. I'll message it.\n[04:43] Muhammad: Okay, when you went there, did you visit your places, your sightseeing historical spots, during Umrah? Like they showed you during Hajj this time, did you see them during Umrah?\n[04:54] Reza: No, they didn't show them during Hajj, and I didn't see them during Umrah either. Because my Hajj package was the shortest. So nothing else was under their package. So I just performed the main Hajj, went to Medina, and then returned to Canada. So I didn't perform any Ziyarah. I couldn't. And when I went to Medina during Umrah, it was the same story. I went for five days. So our main concentration was to spend the main time in Haramain or Medina. And since I was in Medina for two days, we didn't really have much time to spend at other spots. I understand. I do Ziyarah. I didn't do Ziyarah during Umrah. I'm going for Hajj now. Okay, when you traveled to many places, you've been to many places, now you can go to various places by looking at Google Maps or locations. Did you try anything like that, to explore the city yourself? No, I didn't. Actually, at that time, when I went for Umrah, it was my first time seeing these places, so it was in my mind. I went for three days. The objective was to spend as much time as possible in Haram Sharif, and in Medina, the hotel was about 5 minutes walking distance from Masjid an-Nabawi. We spent the majority of those two days there. And this time, I only used Google Maps to go from Masjid an-Nabawi to Quba Mosque. So Google Maps was used then. I went through the path they made for Quba Mosque. Google was used a bit to see the way from the hotel to Masjid an-Nabawi, and to find the walking path from Masjid an-Nabawi to Quba.\n[06:07] Muhammad: I understand, brother. So far, you've had your Hajj and Umrah experience, and you kept it very short. You went for Umrah for three days and only two days in Medina. Your Hajj trip was one that someone who wants to finish everything quickly would desire. So, it seems like the challenging parts of this entire process, what were these challenging parts that you felt? If I could ask you to, please tell me the top three challenging parts.\n[06:40] Reza: Actually, Alhamdulillah, I didn't face many challenges myself. But it could have been more convenient if, for example, the main thing here is, if there was a central system, like when we go through an agency, we request the agency brothers that we want to do this or that. If it's not in their package, they arrange something. Or they make time for a guide or themselves. So, what happens is, if you can't find someone like that sometimes, then it would be better if we could get this help through a centralized system for hotel booking, then taxi booking. I mean, everything can be done, but through separate apps. So, if I want to plan the whole trip from here, say I booked a hotel, good. After booking the hotel, I will go to Haramain or Ziyarah. I will need a taxi here. If there was a centralized system to plan all these in advance, that would be better. And that's it. And challenges, Alhamdulillah, I didn't really face much because, as I said, the main challenge one faces is negotiating with taxi drivers when the hotel is far, when going from the hotel to Haramain Sharif or Masjid an-Nabawi, many ask for higher fares, then you have to bargain. And again, when returning from Mecca, say from Haramain to the hotel, sometimes they close roads. Taxi sellers ask for arbitrary prices. So, you have to walk some distance. So, I would say this is a challenge, this commuting. And if the hotel is far, going from Aziziya to Haram Sharif and returning from Haram Sharif to the hotel in Aziziya during the Hajj season. This commuting is a challenge. And you can say this is the main challenge. And secondly, which I didn't face, although there are many restaurants there. I didn't face any challenges with food. If you search, Google shows all restaurants now. So mainly, I would say this transportation. And another thing is that besides taxis, you can also travel by local buses. Some pilgrims with us had figured out a way to travel by bus. So it would have been good if we had known this beforehand. But there, I saw where the bus stops are. There's a matter of buying bus tickets. I...\n[08:35] Reza: When I went to buy my own ticket, they told me there were no tickets. Yet, others were able to buy tickets. And even if they could buy tickets, some got on the bus without a ticket. And some got tickets from the bus stand. I found it closed when I went. So the main thing is, the challenge I faced during Hajj was this commuting. Traveling from the hotel to Haram Sharif at a fair price was the biggest challenge.\n[09:00] Muhammad: You feel that the most challenging part is travel commuting from point A to point B, and if there is a system that, firstly, will manage a taxi for you at a fair price, or tell you where shuttle services are, or suggest a hotel far from Haram that provides shuttle services or has a taxi contract with them, or tells you how to get to Haram by local bus, then that would be very helpful for you, right?\n[09:50] Reza: Right. Another thing, I don't know if this can be done through an app or if they have any system, the Saudi government, I saw during Hajj that they close roads at various times, they close various routes. If we had this information, for example, if I'm thinking of going by bus, but then I see that the bus route has been closed a few days later, then I wouldn't have taken the bus. For example, if I'm thinking of going by taxi, and I see that the taxi route has been closed for a long time, and it's not possible to go by taxi, maybe a bus is going, if this information is also available, it's very helpful. Because taxi drivers either know and don't tell, or they don't even know that the road will be closed soon.\n[10:17] Muhammad: Okay, let me tell you something, agencies provide this service. Or they sell your car travel, hotel, then airfare, everything together as a package. So if you go for Umrah again later, would you be interested in booking a package from an agency?\n[10:29] Reza: What agencies do is, for example, they do as much as needed for Hajj.\n[10:33] Muhammad: For him, if I want to go, then I have to do it myself, or tell the agency, and they arrange it.\n[10:39] Muhammad: Yes. In that case, you don't need the management hassle. You just tell them, and they manage everything for you, or they have a set package. Where all the core things that pilgrims want are included. So, in that case, do you think going through an agency is a better option?\n[10:52] Reza: It depends. Because when I go through an agency, I have to pay the agency.\n[10:57] Muhammad: Okay. So if I go myself, I don't have to incur that extra agency cost during Hajj, it makes sense. But for Umrah, if one can go individually, I think some price is saved, and I can move at my own pace. Agencies won't always go for Umrah at my desired time, they have a fixed schedule. So, for Umrah, going through an agency might be beneficial for someone, but how economical it will be, I don't know. The main point with agencies is high cost, that. Because you felt you could save money [by doing it yourself]. And the second challenge you felt in the case of [agencies] is their [best guess: rigidity], meaning you have to follow their system, right?\n[11:51] Reza: Yes, this is not actually a problem. Because when I go with an agency, I have to follow the agency's rules.\n[11:57] Muhammad: When I accept it. Now many do, they will send you. If they want, they will send you on a private package, and what happens individually, if you book tickets or hotels yourself from Booking.com, the price you pay, through an agency, you'll get similar things, and a completely private package for you. They will give you the room you ask for, the car you ask for. And they might keep a maximum of 5 to 6% margin. Maybe if you did it yourself, it would cost 1.5 lakh Taka, but through them, it might cost a maximum of 100 dollars more, or a bit more. At that time, do you think it would be reasonable to do it through [an agency]?\n[12:56] Reza: It depends, actually. But if I don't want to take this hassle, it depends. For someone, it might seem natural to just tell them on the phone, and they arrange everything, and for that, I pay a little extra money. Which sounds good. But if someone thinks, no, since I can do it myself, why would I unnecessarily spend some extra money? Actually, if I want to answer this question differently for each person, it depends. For example, if I'm very busy. But I can't do these things myself for Hajj. Then I will choose to tell the agency, \"Arrange something for me according to these criteria.\" But if I have time, then I will look and choose myself, according to my own situation [I will manage]. Let me come to our spiritual guide that you might have used. You also gave personal information there, like improving it further, for example, including some regular duas that we recite, including some videos, including some audios. But overall, how did you find this app? Overall, Alhamdulillah, it seemed good so far. Just one thing, I think it needs a little improvement, meaning, if the font size could be made a bit larger. Because I personally have a problem where I can't see distant things nor close ones. When I hold the phone far away, it becomes clear, but since the phone is far, I can't read the letters. And when I hold the phone very close, the letters become large but blurry. So if the font size could be changed, that's what immediately came to my mind, then it would be a bit convenient for people like me.\n[13:58] Muhammad: Do you think this kind of app will add value for guides and help with things, and for this, if you think you'd have to pay a token, say a one-time fee? In its current state, it doesn't really add much value. But if more new features can be added, for example, because the steps for Umrah or Hajj, people who go usually prepare beforehand. There, for example, I've seen in packages they give a small thing like a tasbih to count how many times I'm performing tawaf, I mean, circuits, that can be counted. And there's also a stopwatch-like thing that people use. What happens is, the app in its current state only provides information. More information can be provided. But the information this app is providing is already available from various sources. So it's kind of like, if you go through an agency, they provide all books or everything additional, so it's not adding much value in its current state. But, I mean, if it's like this... Brother, can you hear?\n[15:10] Reza: Then actually, yes, yes, they can hear. Then actually, maybe people might want to do it. Because they are getting this feature somewhere else if [the app] is like that.\n[15:17] Muhammad: Okay brother, if you were asked to pay an initial fee for this, what other features would be valuable to you here?\n[15:24] Reza: Okay, I understand, brother.\n[15:26] Reza: For example, making some things more convenient. And if through one app, for example, the Shepherd book that was shared, which provides various information about Hajj, and another thing that I think could be provided, which is not available elsewhere, is the history of the places. When we go for Hajj or Umrah, we know we are going to these places. But the history of those places isn't really available, meaning we have to search for it from various sources. But since this app is providing it, for example, we are doing various steps in Umrah. Why are we doing it? If the references behind it can be given, it becomes a bit enriched. For example, the steps of Hajj that we are performing. Why are we doing it? If its Hadith and Quranic references and history can be explained. Differences, meaning some mandatory things that users can see if they want. Then, if the matters of Ziyarat can be included, and the stories behind them can be added, the information base becomes a bit richer. People will then be able to spend more time with it. And another thing, for example, if some tips can be added, if it can be enriched in various ways, then I think the pilgrims will...\n[16:32] Muhammad: So brother, if these things are there, Inshallah, then I think paying an initial fee for such an app won't be much of a problem for you. Right? Yes. And also, another thing is if it's just, yes, yes, you understand, you understand...\n[16:44] Reza: That a person who returned from Hajj, for example, let's say... Okay, I understand. If it's like this, say you made some promises to yourself during Hajj and Umrah, like, \"Okay, from now on, I will pray five times a day in congregation, I will recite Surah Kahf on Fridays,\" yes. And say, \"I will pray Tahajjud one night a week, and I want to go for Umrah again after two years.\" So, a weekly reminder. Okay? And after two years, when Umrah reminds them, \"Do you want to book another Umrah trip?\" Okay? So, what can happen is life can be made a 'Umrah to Umrah' journey. Okay, I just... And in this case, there can also be financial means. If I say, \"Okay, I want to perform Umrah again after two years or five years.\" \"I need to save this much money to perform those Umrahs,\" I agree. Then they agree, it helped with that money, and after five years, it helped them again to go for the next Umrah. If something like this, anything like this, is there, then... Yes.\n[17:54] Reza: So that we don't delete the app. It will feel like, no, I need to keep this app on my phone. To maintain the height of my faith, the app will help me. So many more things need to be added here actually, then I want to take this app to that level.\n[18:03] Muhammad: Okay brother. So today these were mainly my questions for you. The insights I got from you were very valuable. Thank you very much for giving us a long time and sharing your insights for so long. Inshallah Reza bhai, I will enhance the further plan with you and perhaps share some more things with you.\n[18:31] Reza: Okay brother, Inshallah. I also like that you are doing something like this. I am also from this line of work. If I can help in any way in this type of work, it's a pleasure for me.\n[18:40] Muhammad: Okay brother. Assalamu Alaikum. May you be well, Inshallah, you too."

    "english_transcript": "[00:00] Samee: Assalamu Alaikum. This past year, Alhamdulillah, I went to Japan with Shepherds. This year, have you heard of Hasan BC, who is based in Malaysia? Hello? [00:06] Muhammad: Yes, brother, I can hear you. [00:07] Samee: Yes, you've heard of Hasan D.C., right? [00:09] Muhammad: Ah, okay. [00:10] Samee: So Hasan, they are a Malaysia-based venture studio. They mainly finance ethical and Islamic startups, and they also mentor them, kind of like a startup accelerator. So they have a studio program that helps Muslims who want to start businesses before the accelerator. For example, in Bangladesh, you might have heard that Sohag Bhai started something from OnnoRokom Leaders, it's quite similar to that. [00:32] Muhammad: Oh, I see.\n[00:33] Muhammad: So I joined one of their programs. Since I'm interested in Hajj and Umrah, I decided that my part would be to work on the Hajj and Umrah sector. So they have an assignment, which is to interview a mix of groups already working with Hajj and Umrah – be it agencies, pilgrims, hotel providers, or Islamic scholars working as Hajj and Umrah guides. My plan was to interview you as a pilgrim, but now I see, Alhamdulillah, you can help me in multiple ways: as an ex-Hajj pilgrim and also as a new Hajj business entrepreneur. As such, I will ask you some questions for half an hour to get your insights. If you permit, I will keep the meeting recorded, but it will be for internal use for my research, perhaps I will share it with the mentors at Hasan. [01:21] Samee: No problem at all, I'm ready to do anything for you. Thank you, brother. Thank you. [01:25] Muhammad: So Hasan Bhai, Rafi Bhai, shall I begin? Okay, since Rafi Bhai is also here, my first few questions will be based on your past Hajj and Umrah experiences. Then there will be some questions about your new business, and some questions for both of you, for you and Rafi Bhai, on how we can use technology to provide better guidance to pilgrims. Yes. Okay, so let's start with the first questions, Samee Bhai, you performed Hajj twice in 2024 and 2025. Did you perform Umrah?\n[01:53] Samee: I did not specifically go for Umrah; Alhamdulillah, both times I travelled to Saudi Arabia with the intention of Hajj. [01:59] Muhammad: Alhamdulillah. Has Rafi Bhai also performed Hajj or Umrah? He hasn't done it before. Rafi Bhai hasn't performed Hajj or Umrah yet. But Alhamdulillah, Allah has accepted him in such a way that he is going for Hajj along with the management, and he has chosen this for his career journey and life. [02:16] Samee: Alhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah. [02:18] Muhammad: Okay, Samee Bhai, you tell us first, when you performed Hajj twice, from your two Hajj experiences, what were your main challenges as a pilgrim, regarding the logistical aspects like hotels and transport? All of these were handled by Shepherd, but still, even though the whole trip was managed, what were your main challenges? [02:44] Samee: As a pilgrim during Hajj, actually, with how Shepherd worked, there wasn't really much room for challenges, so to speak. However, regarding the management aspect, since I might be a management person, some things related to frequent contact felt a bit noisy to me. What kind of noise? Like constantly communicating on WhatsApp. So I had to keep track of WhatsApp. I felt it was a distraction, which was one of the challenges for me. Other demands actually depended on my mindset, on what my demands were. Other people's demands, for example, might be food, hotel, their comfort. I wasn't that focused on those things. They prepared our mindset in such a way that those things weren't an issue. But I felt that while they provided many services to help us concentrate on Hajj, sometimes it felt noisy. For instance, I had to keep my attention on WhatsApp constantly, waiting for messages. Suddenly a message would pop up saying, \"Pilgrims, there's ice cream here, go check it out.\" I found this unnecessarily very, very less important. Because at the same time, checking so many notifications with everyone. We already suffer from mobile, WhatsApp, or smartphone notifications. And then, having to keep up with so many notifications and updates in one module felt like a problem to me. Rather, this year, when I went for Hajj with a different group, I didn't face such trouble. They had already provided a projection for the next three days right from the start of the day, or rather, they didn't even give daily updates. They gave a projection of what was happening for the next three days every three days. Not sudden, ad-hoc messages. This is very problematic. So for me, this is a very individual feedback. Others might feel that everything is okay, but this is my individual feeling that I need some peace, and checking so many notifications felt noisy. And I think those who managed it this way this year did it right by not giving too many updates. A projection every three days is enough. What would a three-day projection be like? We make business projections for a year or two years. So, if the activities for three days are projected in advance, I think it's better. Some things need to be real-time, like during the main Hajj rituals, when the bus has arrived, everyone should come, it's fine. But these messages should only come when they are absolutely necessary and priority-based, otherwise, it's hard to maintain concentration.\n[04:47] Muhammad: I understand, brother. Brother, let's move to the next question. You stayed in Mecca for a long time, and in Medina for almost a month. During this time, you also travelled around and did sightseeing yourselves, without Shepherd. In this regard, a common problem everyone mentions is that taxi drivers in Mecca and Medina often scam people. They kind of extort money. So what was your experience? Were you satisfied with the transportation you arranged yourselves in Mecca and Medina, apart from Shepherd, or did you feel that something was needed in that sector?\n[05:32] Samee: When travelling without Shepherd, the first problem is language. The second problem is actually what type of people I'm talking to. If my language is okay, since English is not widely used for communication there, and if you don't know Arabic, that's a problem. In that case, it's a bit of an issue. And it seems that those in Medina are much better than those in Mecca, I'm talking about Arabs only. For non-Arabs, among Asians, especially Pakistani drivers, they often charge five or six times more fare, which is simply robbery in plain Bengali. They also commit a lot of injustice and behave rudely, but we haven't seen Arabs do that comparatively. They at least have a certain prestige; they don't commit injustice like Pakistani, Asian, or Indian drivers do with their very rude behaviour. And in Mecca and Medina, what I've seen is that some drivers in Medina, if necessary, sometimes don't even mind if you don't pay the fare; I've encountered such people. So there are good and bad sides. I think among Asian drivers, I would say 85% are unjust. Even if you take an Uber, it's totally safe, but even then, Asian drivers find various excuses. So you have to be very knowledgeable yourself and communicate well with them; that's the kind of experience you get there.\n[07:23] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, brother, let's talk about hotels now. We stayed in the same hotel in Mecca and Medina. It took us 10-15 minutes to reach Haram Sharif from both hotels. Sometimes, people prefer to stay very close, some a bit further, and some prefer to stay very far and use shuttles. So what is your preference? What do you think would give the best experience for pilgrims, balancing money and service? [07:56] Samee: Well, to balance this, I think money is definitely the first factor. Now, if someone has money, they will obviously stay close, brother.\n[08:04] Muhammad: They'll stay at the Intercontinental. Those who have money will definitely not go all the way to Azizia to optimize costs. [08:12] Samee: You understand? Firstly, money definitely matters. Someone's service actually matches their wealth. Some people perform Umrah for 1 lakh 20 thousand Taka, others for 4 lakh Taka. Yes. So I think wealth matters. After that, I think the closer you stay, the better. For example, if I'm in Azizia, I'd struggle to pray every prayer. I'd have to come from there, and I'd need energy. I'd need some rest. I can't maintain concentration for such a long time continuously. So I'd need to drink some coffee or rest for half an hour. I wouldn't need to rest; I'd be exhausted. You understand? In such cases, I'll always try to stay as close as possible according to my means. For example, I want to eat at night after prayer, then quickly get some sleep and leave again around 1:30 or 2:00 AM. I'd stay there, pray, and then come back. So it's easier for me to stay as close as possible. In the future, I will try to stay as close as my wealth allows.\n[09:27] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's talk about hotel services, brother. Both the hotels you stayed in were most likely three-star hotels. But everyone has a concern that they are not happy with the hotel services. What was your perspective on the hotels? [09:47] Samee: Should I talk about 2024 or 2025? [09:49] Muhammad: Talk about both years combined. Overall.\n[09:52] Samee: Okay, in 2024, the hotels we stayed at with Shepherd, I don't know if they could be called three-star. This time, the ones I stayed in were one-star quality, but their service was better than the previous hotels despite the price. [10:11] Samee: Yes, starting from cleanliness to spaciousness and service, here my cost was only 5.5 lakh Taka, and there it was about 7 lakh, nearly 7 lakh Taka, I mean, with other expenses it would be even more. So I think the quality of the hotel this year for 5.5 lakh Taka was far better than what I got last year for 7 lakh Taka.\n[10:35] Samee: Okay, and if you talk about food, there were some changes there. Towards the end, during the main Hajj rituals, a lot of food was provided, a lot was given there. But where I was this time, it was provided consistently. No additional food was given for any special occasion, food was supplied uniformly from beginning to end. [10:59] Muhammad: You mentioned earlier that communication was quite challenging for you at first, but later it was quite good for you. Meaning, that part was more pushy, and later it was more like pulling, they just gave you detailed messages, and then you would communicate if needed. Was WhatsApp the medium of communication? [11:15] Samee: It was WhatsApp. [11:16] Muhammad: I see. Now, brother, let's talk about your exploration. When you went for Hajj and Umrah, you definitely spent some time exploring, shopping, seeing places, and eating out yourselves. How was this exploration for you, and did you feel like you were finding the right places, or did you feel like you didn't recognize the places and needed a guide? [11:42] Samee: Definitely, there should be a guide for those who are completely new. For both new and old pilgrims, having a guide would certainly make things more comfortable and easier. We've seen with Shepherd that they would charge extra for a Ziyarah, for example, 50 or 100 Riyals. They were present, conducting various tours in different places, and the duration was longer. Okay?\n[12:12] Samee: But this time, what we did was free. So for free service, the duration was certainly shorter, and the explanation was less. Shepherd's service was a bit better in that regard, but it also cost more and involved more time. So, having a guide is definitely a good idea, in my opinion. A tourist might think, \"I'll go to Jeddah by the sea, take a look around. I've been here for a long time, so I'll go to Jeddah in the afternoon and return in the evening.\" In such cases, a guide might not be necessary. For example, taking pilgrims to Jeddah for Ziyarah, I think that's a bit different. It's not usually done like that. For showing the city of Jeddah, I don't think a guide is needed. But for other places, suppose you're taking me to Badr, or other historical places. Yes, there, a guide is necessary. Even if there's an Islamic scholar, and they highlight the historical plots and various incidents from the Prophet's biography, I think that's good. [13:14] Muhammad: You saw that the guidance we received, it was given by Sheikh Monjin, who often just sent audio recordings. And in that case, you yourselves went around and explored. Do you think this self-exploration with an audio guide can fill that gap, or is a human guide really necessary sometimes? [13:42] Samee: Sometimes it's not possible. This idea was actually mine, in your management, I think it was last year, I told them that Sheikh couldn't communicate properly or on time in the bus, with everyone together. I told Saleh Bhai, tell the Sheikh to sit in front and send audio recordings, three to four minutes long, okay? Meaning, in real-time, because connectivity was an issue, and using a microphone wouldn't reach everyone, since everyone had WhatsApp. While going on the bus, if he explains, that's good. And I think sending audio recordings is better than joining a Google Meet, because everyone talks at once, and it's hard to keep everyone's attention at the same time. So the audio recording that Sheikh sent at that time, I recommended it. After that, they started this process, and I definitely recommend it. [14:52] Muhammad: Oh, so you're saying that from no guide at all, an audio guide is the next level, and a human guide is perfect.\n[15:02] Samee: Perfect. Yes. [15:04] Muhammad: Okay, I understand. Now, brother, let's talk about Hajj. Hajj is a challenging act of worship. You have performed Hajj twice, and the first time you went alone with friends, and this time you went with an elderly female relative. What challenges do you think pilgrims generally face during Hajj? [15:35] Samee: In this case, brother, to be honest, challenges are really about uncertain arrivals; the permits come very late, and the management is not within our control, you understand? So, such uncertainties, they are a bit challenging – when will what happen? And challenges, specifically, regarding the two managements, last year it was Shepherd. I don't really have any major complaints about it. I didn't face any management challenges because, you know, many elderly people were facing challenges, many had different physical problems, were sick, those were other challenges. So, overall, last year, there were no major challenges in that way. And this year, if I say, I didn't really face challenges that way, from my side, I didn't face any major problems. One challenge that can be mentioned is after reaching Mina, during the last two or three days of throwing stones at the Jamarat, we developed a habit of being taken back to the hotel. This is a challenge, but this time, this challenge was a bit less because I came by train.\n[17:01] Muhammad: Hmm. [17:02] Samee: So, if I were to say, this time too, the challenges were quite few. I can say that I didn't really face any major challenges. [17:11] Muhammad: Alhamdulillah. Okay, hypothetically speaking, Samee Bhai, you are in this business now, but if you weren't, if you were to go for Umrah next time, would you go through an agency or would you go by yourself? What do you think? [17:28] Samee: I would go by myself. I wouldn't go through an agency. I would go alone. [17:34] Muhammad: Okay. [17:35] Samee: Maybe we would go as a group, on our own. [17:38] Muhammad: I understand, I understand. So we've heard about many challenges and perspectives. Now, do you think in which areas, like AI, machine learning, or mobile apps, can make the pilgrims' journey easier, especially for those who are going by themselves without an agency?\n[18:03] Samee: You're asking how AI can help, right? [18:05] Muhammad: AI or mobile app, technology in general. [18:07] Samee: This can actually guide the pilgrim regarding temperature, weather, etc., at that time, which AI will help with. What we already have, what AI can do, you mentioned language, language barrier. [18:20] Muhammad: Yes, it can do that. It can. I've already tried it. I've tried to understand what Google's Samsung Google Interpreter is saying, and what live Uthpa is saying, but it doesn't really work well; it's often incorrect. Another thing is, we all used to carry small printed books, like a guide. In that case, do you think an offline app, one I shared with you, an app I developed, could be an alternative to those guide books?\n[19:02] Samee: Yes, it can definitely be an alternative and can be very useful. Yes, I've used it too, but one thing I've noticed is that if I have something printed in my hand, it feels like the connectivity is better than on a mobile phone. With a mobile, you often feel like taking a picture or doing something else. So, if I want to give my full concentration, having something printed feels a bit better. [19:42] Muhammad: Brother, this is my last question to you regarding technology and as a pilgrim. It's about an app. What if there was an app that offered spiritual guidance, on top of hotel logistics and location details? Plus, when you go for Ziyarah, it would have descriptions and significance of various places. And after Hajj, there would be a program with Islamic scholars or life coaches to help people maintain the spirit of Hajj. For instance, the idea could be that after you perform Hajj, you plan for one year: I will pray regularly in congregation for a year, give this much in charity, and perform Tahajjud once a week. The app would remind you of these things. And another feature could be if you plan to perform Umrah two years later, it gives you a financial plan, like how you can save five lakh Taka per month for two years. If there was such an app, would people use it? Would they pay for it?\n[20:56] Samee: Yes, yes, this is definitely important. I am also thinking about an SIP model, a Systematic Investment module, you might know it as SIP, which can help someone plan for their Hajj by saving small amounts over time. If there are such guidelines or modules in an app, it would be good. Reminders would be good. [21:30] Muhammad: Brother, since you are a business entrepreneur and you also work with crowdfunding in many cases, do you think it's possible from an investment perspective to have a very defensive investment like this? Where the chance of loss is very low. Or in that case, pilgrims would deposit some money. Even if they get a limited profit, it would make their Hajj journey easier. Is it possible to design such a portfolio, right? According to your language? [22:04] Samee: Yes, it is possible, we are working on it. [22:07] Muhammad: Okay, now let me ask Rafi Bhai a few simple questions about his experience. Insha'Allah, you are starting your journey with the Ummah Hajj Portal. So, Insha'Allah, you will be in management, and you are also, Insha'Allah, hoping to go for Hajj next year. Since you have never been before, what things do you personally find challenging? What things are you confused about? What things make you feel scared, which you feel would be better if you had extra support?\n[22:45] Rafiuzzaman: Firstly, going to the House of Allah as a guest of Allah, there's a good fear that I will have the opportunity to go to such a place of Allah. Secondly, the places where Rasulullah (peace be upon him) and the Sahaba (companions) most frequently visited, where their Dawah (preaching) efforts involved sweat and blood, from Medina to Uhud to the places in Mecca, there's a feeling in my heart to go to these places. Because for those who study Seerah (biography of the Prophet), Mecca and Medina are very much related to them. So, there's a fascination to go to these places, Insha'Allah. If you talk about management, Alhamdulillah. In this case, for example, the pilgrims we are currently in contact with have many questions. They want everything good. They want good hotels, they want to stay closer, they want all transportation facilities. There are some such issues. And we also encounter those who have foreign citizenship but wish to go with a Bangladeshi passport. They have such a desire, but they don't have a Bangladeshi passport, and they are seeking advice on what to do. Overall, what we are facing is that there are some pilgrims who only see it as a trip, only focusing on the generic aspect, like \"I'm just going, that's it.\" It's not like that. Whether we can properly make them understand that this is a spiritual journey and that they need to take it that way, that is a challenging issue for us, to make them feel that. And another challenging issue for us is that there are many people here, yes, who gather five or five and a half lakh Taka with great difficulty, by selling land or by any means. And they want this to be money earned through their hardship. Yes, so our challenge is to provide them with complete support and good service at a low cost or at the minimum economic level. [24:59] Muhammad: I understand, brother. However, brother, let me share a few things here. Since you will Insha'Allah also be working as a Hajj trainer, I've received feedback, especially from some very close people of mine who went for Hajj this year, they were all Canada-based. Their challenge was that they couldn't attend these trainings because the trainings were live and they couldn't enjoy them much if they attended too late. Now, since tech platforms have advanced so much, do you think technology can play a good role in the Hajj training modules to help pilgrims be spiritually and mentally prepared?\n[25:52] Rafiuzzaman: What I mean is, when you train pilgrims to go for Hajj, spiritually and mentally, do you think technology can play a good role in helping with the training sessions? I think specifically that technology can help here, especially for training sessions, because many might not be able to attend physical training, or their locations might be different, someone from Chittagong, someone from other countries, right? So in this case, technology will definitely play a good role. Be it Zoom, Meet, or any kind of custom-made platform that gives us a good meeting interface and allows us to provide one-to-one guidance to pilgrims through good presentations. If such technology is better than Zoom, I hope it will be very good for us to train them up. [27:07] Muhammad: So Rafi Bhai, you are a trainer contracted with One Ummah, but you are also a preacher, and many people benefit from you. Now, many Ummah might only be able to take a maximum of 500 or 1000 pilgrims, but it seems that many more people could benefit in terms of Islamic knowledge. In that case, do you think that your training modules can certainly be opened for other pilgrims besides One Ummah, for a fee, technologically, just a [inaudible]?\n[27:42] Rafiuzzaman: There's a slight mismanagement, I mean, a misunderstanding here. It's that I'm not in training management. Currently, I'm in charge of the entire setup management, as the head of this section. It seems that we can hire trainers from Shepherd. We can hire them, right? For our perspective, we can bring them to provide good guidance to our pilgrims. To bring in good Hajj trainers. Yes. We are keeping this option open, it's not like our people have to do it. We can bring good people from outside, any good scholars, and arrange a training system through them. [28:44] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's move on to the Hajj journey, brother. During the Hajj journey, a person usually stays for 20 to 40 days, and often it is seen that pilgrims' spiritual engagement is not very deep, except for a few two-hour sessions. But this 20 to 40 days can be created as a spiritual boot camp for serious pilgrims, who can use this event as a pivotal moment for their Islamic spirituality, so that after this event, their Islamic practice can improve. So, in this case, how do you think you can plan this 20-day period for pilgrims as a spiritual boot camp through technology? [29:43] Rafiuzzaman: If I talk about the use of technology in Hajj, one of the main objectives of our initiative is to connect pilgrims with Mecca and Medina, to make them feel it, which perhaps only a handful of others do. We want to give our best in this field so that pilgrims can feel why they are going for Hajj. So, in this case, for example, if we want to connect them during the other 20 days, these places in Mecca and Medina where the Sahaba (companions) trod, where Rasulullah (peace be upon him) walked, where Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and his family walked - when we connect them historically to these places, after giving a brief beforehand, relating a story from the Seerah (biography of the Prophet) or what happened at that time in that place, yes, you know, we are going to a place whose history is this, which is related to this verse of the Quran, there are related Hadith, the Sahaba used to think this way - after giving such a brief, when we go to the place, then a...\n[31:07] Rafiuzzaman: ...we can use a device technologically if it's good for us. For example, we can give each pilgrim something like an air-type device in their ear, and I have a microphone. So, there won't be a noisy situation like using a loudspeaker or anything like that. I'll be talking, and my pilgrims will hear me clearly. Yes, they will be watching and connecting with my words. This technology can be a very good asset for all these connections. You understand what I'm saying? Like a radio system. In noisy environments, you know that if you use a mic, the police will catch you and take you to the police station. So, in this case, you can use technology for this purpose during the 20-day Ziyarah part. For example, we usually use WhatsApp call-to-all or Meet regularly. Sometimes, it gets disconnected or has various problems. If we can use exclusive tech to communicate there, it would be better. We recently heard that Europeans use such tech, devices in their ears while walking, and they hear very clearly. [32:51] Samee: And within those 20 days, brother, what do you know? I think Hajj should be about total, complete grooming first. And then, once you're there, for those 20 days, I think I can only dedicate a maximum amount of time to the Kaaba in Mecca. My education part there will be less. There can be reminders, a framing schedule, charts indicating \"20 days left, 18 days left, 17 days left, what have you done?\" Yes, there can be a checklist there, you understand? I think technology should be engaged in such a way that it doesn't take up too much time there. Just a framework. Like how we write things down manually, instead of using paper, there can be a chart there. You understand?\n[33:57] Samee: And regarding Ziyarah, brother, what he said is very good, even if he didn't mention it. In Ziyarah, the environment is noisy. Many people don't know things. And I think it's about just having something like \"I have this much time left for reminder,\" these kinds of things can be done. And documentation will be there. And I think during that time, the most important thing is the connection between Allah and His servant. If someone doesn't know Du'a, it can be written in Bengali, or they can say it in Bengali. Yes, some inspiration can be given that even if you can't do anything else, talk about these things. Sometimes you see how Arabs make Du'a, it feels like they are playing a Test match and we are playing a T20, something like that. We can't do it like them sometimes, and we can't say it the way they do. I've noticed a lot of difference in the style of making Du'a between Bangladeshis, Arabs, and non-Arabs. When they make Du'a, it feels like they are talking right now, you understand? But for us, it seems our connection isn't that strong. They might be smoking cigarettes, whatever it is neutral, what they are saying. But when they make Du'a, what I see is that it feels like they are so close to Allah. We don't feel that close. So, to establish connectivity with Allah, Du'a is the best thing. If those things are there properly, Alhamdulillah.\n[35:36] Muhammad: Samee Bhai, let me ask a question here. There are some etiquettes for Du'a. For example, first, praising Allah. Then, sending Salawat (blessings) upon Rasulullah (peace be upon him). After that, making the Du'as. Then, Du'a can be augmented. For example, you can make Du'a using the names of Allah. Through your good deeds. Then, again, you might need something, but you know that some of your brothers also need it. When you make Du'a for your brothers, the angels will make Du'a for you. There are some techniques for Du'a that Rasul [inaudible]. [36:20] Samee: This time, when making Du'a, for example, I wrote down three or four pages, and I couldn't even manage to follow them, you understand? I don't know, I saw that others' situations were even worse than mine. My situation was bad, that's why I wrote some things, step by step, to help myself. So I remember it, I make Du'a, then I look at it again and read, and then make Du'a again. I saw, even at Rawdah, they were making Du'a as if they could see him right there, brother, talking in Arabic. That's why I mentioned these things.\n[37:19] Muhammad: Samee Bhai, I made a small tool that I'll share with you. It's like, when you make a list of Du'as in the same way, what the AI will do is take your Du'a list and augment it. For example, before each Du'a in the list, it will add some names of Allah. For Rasulullah (peace be upon him), what will it add? It can add Durud (salutations). It will add that. What kind of Du'a intention should it be? Then it will search if Rasulullah (peace be upon him) taught any such Arabic Du'a, and it will add those Du'as. After that, it will make your Du'a beautiful by including the Muslim Ummah, how to include those around you, etc. Do you think a Du'a crafting tool like this, just as we use AI to write applications or for office work, why shouldn't we call upon Allah beautifully? So, can we learn these things from AI?\n[38:20] Samee: Yes, yes, it can be done, it can be done. [38:23] Muhammad: Ultimately, the knowledge comes from Rasulullah (peace be upon him), and AI is just helping to explain it. Right. Yes. [38:29] Muhammad: Okay, Rafi Bhai, last question regarding this, then we'll move to management-related questions. It's about the post-Hajj period. We often see that after Hajj and Umrah, there's a great enthusiasm, but after three months, it's often back to how it was. For this, do you think we can have a post-Hajj boot camp, at least one month or one year, with monthly or bi-monthly check-ins for pilgrims? Can such a program be kept to maintain the spirit of Hajj? [39:20] Rafiuzzaman: Yes, that would be good.\n[39:23] Muhammad: Okay, brother, now let's move to the management side. So, what I've seen from the management is when... [39:28] Samee: Brother, let me tell you, Insha'Allah, we will be able to give more time later. We have two guests waiting outside for us. [39:34] Muhammad: Okay, alright, then let's conclude for today. Insha'Allah, I will sit with you another day, okay? [39:41] Samee: Yes, I am available tomorrow as well, no problem. [39:43] Muhammad: Alright, brother, Insha'Allah, Assalamu Alaikum. [39:46] Samee: Okay, okay, brother, okay, Assalamu Alaikum."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: Assalamu Alaikum, sister. Sister, can you hear me? Hello.\nShamima Ara Leera: Hello.\nMuhammad: Yes, sister, can you hear me?\nShamima Ara Leera: Yes, sister. Alhamdulillah.\nMuhammad: Sister, let me give you some context. This meeting is part of my application to an entrepreneurship studio called Hasan.vc. My goal here is to try and build some apps to help pilgrims during Hajj and Umrah. So, in this meeting, I might ask you some open-ended questions about your experiences and I will share some potential solutions with you. Insha'Allah, you will honestly suggest whether these will actually be beneficial or if they are not really needed. Based on this, Insha'Allah, I will be able to design the idea for my app. This is the perspective.\nShamima Ara Leera: Alright, okay.\nMuhammad: So, Insha'Allah, sister, let's start. Please begin by introducing yourself. Specifically, related to Hajj and Umrah, when did you perform Hajj and Umrah in your life? Let's start by sharing that, Insha'Allah.\nShamima Ara Leera: I am Shamima Ara Leera. I am a professional, actually by profession. I was an engineer, I mean, I was in the telecom industry. I am not currently working, though. I went for Hajj for the first time in 2014. That was a very short-duration journey for my Hajj, and I didn't really have the preparation for that Hajj either. But Alhamdulillah, whatever preparation we managed to take, we attended a class for preparation. From there, we were actually able to learn quite a bit. But honestly, I mean, I really learned many things mainly after going for Hajj, after arriving there. What I learned was from our, I mean, our surrounding pilgrims or mainly the Hajj group people and also people from other countries with whom I interacted. Especially, I spoke with some Malaysian women, some Arab, some Pakistani. So, my experience with them was actually very good during my first Hajj. And what was the main difference was that we grew up, we weren't really practicing Muslims in that sense. We actually, after this first Hajj, we actually began to understand, to some extent, the concept of a practicing Muslim. But Alhamdulillah, I tried to adopt that; it was my effort. Because honestly, to be very frank, my parents used to pray and fast. But we didn't really belong to a practicing Muslim family in that way. Because my father was a university professor. To be honest, we weren't really practicing Muslims in that way. But this Hajj experience was actually a big turning point in my life, I would say. And I myself, since I was in a corporate culture, working in a corporate job, so the environment there was totally different. But after going for Hajj, I, I felt that after returning from Hajj, it was a turning point in my life.\nShamima Ara Leera: And after returning from Hajj, honestly, I had never read Hadiths in my life. That was a big thing for me that within one month of returning from Hajj, Alhamdulillah, I was able to read Bukhari Sharif. I mean, it was a translation, but I had that. Plus, reading the Tafsir of the Quran. That also came from there for me, and as I said, it was a huge turning point for my life.\nMuhammad: Wow, Alhamdulillah. Sister, Insha'Allah, we will talk about your Hajj journey and your transformation after Hajj a bit later. First, sister, let's talk about your Hajj preparation. Especially as a woman, what we see in our society is that most Hajj instructors are men. So, did you feel that this created an obstacle in terms of asking questions, learning these matters?\nShamima Ara Leera: Yes, there is indeed a point to that. Since most of our instructors are men, our main education was where we used to go for classes; we had very short-duration classes. Alhamdulillah, we were able to complete them within two or three weeks. Then, whatever we managed to do, where we used to go for classes, their family, it was like a home-based setup. So, some women would come within the family, and we shared experiences with them. But actually, the main thing I feel in the context of our country, what is lacking among our women, I think, regarding Hajj, is manners, or 'adab'. By 'adab', I mean there is a certain mannerism for Mecca and Medina. Plus, we are culturally quite behind, meaning, in respect to having only bookish knowledge, not Islamic or spiritual knowledge, which is a bit less among us. In that case, I think for women, there is actually a lot to learn. I mean, how we should behave with others, there are things to learn about these matters. And we are talking about our, I mean, the culture of those of us who are educated city people. But I interacted with some people there who were not that educated, maybe just a little literate. But Alhamdulillah, their spiritual side, they are very advanced spiritually. By advanced, I mean their Taqwa (piety) is very high. But our women, they actually have some lacking in certain areas. That is, many things, since the instructors are men, they don't really cover how one woman should behave with another woman, plus what kind of problems women face when they go there. What do we all do?\nShamima Ara Leera: We all normally try to learn these things by hearing from others, from the experiences of familiar people who went for Hajj before. But I think it would be better if Hajj instructors tried to cover the issues concerning women more. And what I feel, I'm not saying this as a woman, I'm saying it in general, as a general human being. That is, how one person's interaction with another should be. I mean, if I say it, it might seem like I'm exaggerating, but it's not. What I mean is that we women tend to be a bit more impatient and easily get frustrated. But Hajj is really a matter of patience, a huge test of patience. So, to maintain patience, one needs to know many things that perhaps many of us women do not know, or our families haven't culturally educated us in that way. This is actually where there is a lacking among our women. It's true. Not everyone grows up in an Islamic environment, nor are they practicing Muslims. And just because one is a practicing Muslim, it doesn't mean these things will automatically come to them. It cannot always be expected. But I think if more priority is given to the matter of 'adab', and the aspects of interaction with others, I think it would be better to work on these, more than just the procedures and logistics. This matter is actually the most important thing: that I am going for Hajj, and someone else is my Hajj companion, and I should not behave badly with them. These matters, I think, would be better if they were instilled more in people's hearts.\nMuhammad: I understand, sister. Okay, now sister, the courses you took, they were all in-person courses, right?\nShamima Ara Leera: By in-person, I mean many, many people would come there, so it was a course, right?\nMuhammad: Yes, yes, in-person.\nMuhammad: Now, sister, these courses, we see a lot of content online these days. We watch videos, tutorials, and the thing is, we can learn sitting at home. And often, we have busy lives. Then there are many responsibilities. Especially for our sisters, they have many household responsibilities. So, what do you think, if we could bring these lectures into a recorded and on-demand system, where you can watch them at your convenience, would this add value for pilgrims? Or is in-person attendance absolutely essential?\nShamima Ara Leera: I think, yes, it would definitely add value. Now, actually, I mean, when we went, I'm talking about 2014, or 2022 was our second time. Recording, I mean, the current aspect has changed. Yes, I mean, now for everything, we see myself searching on YouTube, watching a video, learning. That definitely gives a good idea to a certain level. There's no doubt about that. But actually, in-person interaction, that also has a need. I mean, it's not like 100% of everything happens only through recorded aspects. That's not right. However, now, actually, many things have developed. So, it can mostly be covered. But for the experiential matters, those might be covered through quizzes or mostly frequently asked questions, we try to use those for much of it. But actually, I think, I mean, we can cover about 90% perhaps, and for the remaining 10%, if there's any interaction, that would be good.\nMuhammad: Okay, I understand. Now, sister, if we share the learning medium, sometimes learning doesn't solidify by just watching routine videos or lectures. In that case, a proof matrix is learning through quizzes. So, if we do it this way, say, there are small modules, and after these modules, pilgrims are given scenario-based quizzes on patience, or on rituals. For example, it might be asked: \"Your fellow pilgrim next to you is a bit unwell, and they snore at night when they sleep. What would you do in this situation?\" Options could be: would you complain to them for a few days? Would you change rooms? Or if possible, would you be patient? If such questions are asked, do you think they would help reinforce learning among people?\nShamima Ara Leera: Actually, the thing is, it depends on the audience. Actually, it might develop day by day or not, meaning, it's difficult to expect it to come so quickly. I mean, that's why I'm saying that this would definitely add value if done. But I don't think this percentage of the audience will really have a very big impact on many people. Because we actually like to read less. And the matter of exams, I mean, a quiz feels kind of like an exam. So, for this reason, we tend to avoid it again, something like that happens.\nShamima Ara Leera: For this reason, yes, if it's there, definitely it's good. But I mean, I'm just commenting that its impact won't really be very widespread among people, I think.\nMuhammad: I understand. So, it can be kept optional. I understand, sister. Now tell me, when you went for Hajj, during your Hajj period, regarding the various logistical hurdles, like handling luggage, managing plane tickets, managing cars – did you actively participate in these, or were these mainly handled by the men in the family? And in that case, as a sister, what kind of logistical challenges did you actually have to face?\nShamima Ara Leera: It was actually mixed. But regarding logistical challenges, actually, the thing is, for women, logistical matters have improved a lot now. It's not like before. I mean, when we went in 2014, we had to handle our own luggage ourselves. But now, in 2022, what I've seen is that logistics have improved a lot. And other matters, as I mentioned, those are problems for some women who, I mean, whose education level is such that they might not be able to operate a mobile phone or a smartphone, for them it's a hassle. For many women in Bangladesh, they get lost, can't recognise places, these things are there. But those are not for women who would use an app. Those are for women from absolutely rural or remote areas. But normally, I don't think women have to face such hassles from a logistical point of view now. Now, many things are available.\nMuhammad: Okay, sister, now let's talk about the acts of worship. When you were performing the Hajj rituals, like Tawaf, Sa'i, there are many supplications (duas) – some are Sunnah duas, some are mandatory duas. And Hajj itself is an act of worship involving a lot of supplication. In this case, we go with the intention to make many duas. So, how did you manage these duas? Did you memorise them, or did you write them down somewhere in notes, or did you keep a book? This is the first question. And the second question is, do you think with current technology, if these duas were available in a mobile app, very organised in a checklist format, and that would be beneficial for people?\nShamima Ara Leera: Yes, if they are in a checklist format, it would definitely be beneficial. Now, it would definitely be beneficial for review. But actually, when we go for Tawaf and Sa'i, sometimes it's not possible to read from a mobile phone in that situation. But definitely, having a checklist helps me memorise and check at a glance. It makes finding things easier. That's definitely there. But what we did, we followed the traditional way, perhaps with personalised checklists or many booklets are given through various agencies, or we ourselves find information by going through books. So, we definitely memorised them in our own way. But sometimes, to take extra precaution, alongside memorising, we keep a booklet or whatever feels convenient close at hand so that we don't make mistakes. So, in that case, as you said, having it in an app, what happens is that I can memorise all of them together and organise them easily. It becomes easy, yes, this is it. Because in books, many people discuss the context. The context will definitely be there. But still, everyone expects it in an app that, let's say, I'm doing Sa'i, what dua will I say near the green light, or what will I do? So, these things, yes, definitely, it's good. But as I said, there's also a lot of crowd at that time. In that case, it depends on each person's personal choice. Will someone feel convenient reading from a mobile, or will they use a book or write it down themselves or use a checklist from an agency? Personal preference will be a factor, and the environment is also a factor, that if there's too much crowd, then handling the mobile...\nMuhammad: Okay, sister, what if you were given a device, say, like a smartwatch? Yes, now, considering the crowded conditions, this smartwatch would have several features. First of all, when you are in a crowd, you can press a button on this smartwatch to keep track of your Tawaf counts, how much Tawaf you have done or not. Secondly, the duas would be available in text form. But you wouldn't be able to read the duas directly. Instead, if you have a Bluetooth headphone connected, you could press a button, and your preferred duas would play in your ear. Then you can remember them and recite the duas. And even after Hajj, in your daily life, you could use it for Quran recitation and dua memorization, Insha'Allah. If such a smartwatch device were given to you, and its price was within five to ten thousand Taka, would you buy it for Hajj and for daily use afterwards?\nShamima Ara Leera: I think this, this actually, I don't think that hardware will be very popular. Because now everyone prefers to use one device, I mean, not multiple devices. I mean, for example, I'm talking to you now. Yes. So, I would normally want to be able to do things very simply, with as few devices as possible. So, in that case, I don't think this matter will work out. I said if it's within an application, definitely the duas within the app, I might prefer that over a mobile, I mean, having another device. Because as I said, many devices can create complexity.\nShamima Ara Leera: What happens now? People normally try to buy a mobile phone that can do maximum tasks.\nMuhammad: Keeping it on mobile is a better option. Now, let's come to the rituals during the Hajj days. For example, during Hajj days, we make a lot of duas, especially in Arafah and Mina. Also, in Hajj, some logistical challenges arise. So, what if it was like this: there were two options for your spiritual guidance for Mina, Arafah, Muzdalifah – their Sunnah and rituals. And here, through an interactive map, you could see which places are beneficial for you. For example, in Muzdalifah, there are many mosques, there are some Sunnah significances of the Prophet (PBUH), and in Arafah. So, if these things are provided, do you think it would add benefit for pilgrims? And in that case, pilgrims would be able to add their own duas, which pilgrims want to make privately in Mina and Muzdalifah?\nShamima Ara Leera: This, this would definitely benefit. Because most people in our country actually know less about these matters. Most topics are not covered, like that these are important factors. These are not really covered. Another thing I think, I don't know if you have added it. Firstly, for Hajj preparation, definitely, along with spiritual preparation, I think you can also add that. Just my idea is that Hajj is actually a big part of physical activity. Physical preparation is also a necessary factor for Hajj preparation. This actually needs to make people aware that...\nMuhammad: I have to be physically prepared from before going for Hajj. Practicing walking or these things, if we don't do that, suddenly many of us find we can't do it there. And problems like that arise. So, in the case of Hajj, having the habit of walking is important for physical preparation. Besides walking, what else can be done now?\nShamima Ara Leera: Besides walking, what else can be done is, I mean, to have a total idea of the path, by path I mean the idea of the places, that can be made visible. I mean, specifically the gates of Mecca, plus other communication factors, there can be an introductory aspect about those, like where you will go, where you will go to communicate, plus where the toilets are, where the lost and found is, where you will go in case of an emergency, how you will interact – I don't know if it's possible to incorporate these things, but if those matters could be covered, I think it would be good.\nShamima Ara Leera: Everyone gives duas or wants to add duas or these things. But if those matters could be covered...\nMuhammad: Yes, regarding logistics, let me share an important thing that many pilgrims say is a major problem for them: when going for Hajj, police often block roads from one side, or redirect you from another side due to crowds. And you might know that in 2024, Alhamdulillah, it was very good this time. Many pilgrims also passed away in 2024. Yes, in this regard, we are thinking of a few things for these logistical challenges. One is that there will be a stream, like what we see on Facebook, but it will be specific to Hajj and Umrah and specific to pilgrims. In that case, when you go for Hajj, you will be able to stay connected with people around you location-wise. And you can message there. Only people around you will see this. And if you feel unwell or have any problem, you can press an SOS button, and people around you will be notified that this pilgrim is unwell here. And at the same time, you can share your live location with your agency and your family members, who will be able to see where you are. And with this, for example, if any pilgrim falls into trouble, the government can also benefit from these things if needed. Here, a major challenge arises in assisting pilgrims, such as pilgrims sharing their location and actively sharing with other pilgrims where there is trouble, if someone is stuck, or if a road is closed. And at the same time, pilgrims sacrificing some of their privacy by sharing their location, \"where I am,\" with everyone, and in return, I can see others' locations and I am benefited, just like how maps work. Do you think you would participate in this? Would it be beneficial?\nShamima Ara Leera: Yes, it would be beneficial. It needs to be done that way, I mean, the marketing policy could be like this: that you don't always share your location during Hajj. When you see Hajj days are important or when there's more traffic or more people, then do this. It's not always necessary for you to do it. It can be promoted this way. Because that's one thing. Definitely, location is an important factor because it saves time. And what you said about 2024, when there's a mass volume, such incidents do happen. We see it. Once, during our first Hajj, we had such an experience where a pilgrim became very ill, then became weak. Later, we gave him some saline. Then two brothers and I, with great difficulty, brought him back to Mecca by arranging a car. Arranging a car on Hajj day... So, such incidents do happen. But what I think is, another thing can be added to it. I don't know if, I'm just giving an idea. That is, when a person registers for the app, immediately, there could be a phone number for their emergency contact person, just a button or something. Pressing it would be like speed dial, or the number could be pre-entered in the app, and they send a message or, as you said, to their Facebook ID or whatever, a message is generated there. This could include the location, or the SOS could be directly dialed. I don't know how possible dialing would be.\nMuhammad: I understand, sister. Now, sister, let's move on to another question. After hearing your story, it seemed to me that your Hajj, Alhamdulillah, was a transformative experience for your life. But for many, Hajj isn't that meaningful. So, would you share what things you did during Hajj that gave you such a transformative experience, Alhamdulillah, and how we can convey this to other pilgrims through an app? For conveying it through an app, first, please share your experience – what things you did during Hajj, especially during the 2014 Hajj, that were transformative for you? Then we'll move on to the app part.\nShamima Ara Leera: Actually, what I mean is, for transformation, the main thing for me is that in 2014 Hajj, I saw many pilgrims around me whose piety amazed me greatly. Plus, their dedication. By dedication, I mean how they were reading the Quran or praying with faith in Allah. For example, a Malaysian woman talked to me and asked me where I was from. Then she told me to pray, and she said she would pray for me, that Allah solve all my problems. So, what I saw was that praying for one another, wishing well for one another – these things, we didn't really grow up in that environment. We didn't grow up that way meaning we rarely see these things in our society. Plus, these things are less common in our culture. Plus, sharing, the matter of sharing. The matter of sharing is that even a very poor person shares their very small possessions, and a rich person also shares. So, I never thought that people could share things with each other like this, which we rarely see among people around us. And that thing was most impactful for me. And as I said, I saw some people who were absolutely poor, meaning they had nothing. Yet they came for Hajj for the sake of Allah's pleasure. I saw some people who, when they go for Hajj, don't have much food or other things. People would keep those things, meaning they would take them home. So, many people might have abundance, but we have less. And the matter of having faith in Allah, that was something that was learned by sitting in the mosque and sharing personal stories with many people there. Plus, in Medina, Medina was a big learning experience. In Medina, after Asr prayer, there's a session for women, I don't know if there's a male part too, where they teach things. How to pray, how to bring concentration in prayer. And as I said, interaction with people from different countries. There, what I understood was that our culture of practicing...\nShamima Ara Leera: ...Muslims is very less. We actually do everything just for show, it seems. And from my personal perspective, the transformation I needed, what I did was, I was used to corporate culture. In corporate culture, what should I say, everything is like corporate politics, meaning blaming one's fault on another. So, the fact that this is not right, I wouldn't have felt that if I hadn't gone for Hajj. Because we are so used to corporate life, blaming others for our mistakes. But that this is a great sin, that it should not be done, I understood that there, I mean, the thing is, everything is from Allah Ta'ala. Now, everyone can accept that. Alhamdulillah, Allah has given me this ability, I am trying. There is no end to learning in a person's life. It is said, is it not, that one can be a believer in the morning and lose faith in the evening. So, regarding practice, what I saw there was people from various countries, especially the women I saw, they love the Quran immensely, they read the Quran and practice it in their conduct. This is less common among us. And in people's manners, plus in everything, we should try. So, I try. What I felt then was, initially, before going to that place, I didn't observe complete hijab as it is understood. I used to wear hijab, but not complete hijab as it is understood. So, Alhamdulillah, from Hajj, from the preparation for Hajj, when I started, since then I came into complete hijab, and then from then on, I felt that, no, my first understanding of the matter of hijab was in this. Then, as I said, reading Hadith or Tafsir of the Quran, that came to me in that way. I saw them, I mean, by 'them' I mean people from various countries, Malaysian, Arabic, then Iranian, Pakistani. Especially Indonesian, Malaysian, and Iranian women, whom I saw, they really cherish the One (Allah) a lot. And praying for others, forgiving others' mistakes, these things help people. This mentality of helping people, it's unfortunate that this is what our education system, our culture, some aspects are religious. This is what it is for us.\nMuhammad: I understand, sister. Sister, in that case, what we can do to connect with pilgrims is, for example, social...\nMuhammad: ...networking, the way it connects all of us, but here there is a lot of content that is not Islamically appropriate. So, for connecting with pilgrims, if such a social networking platform can be made during Hajj, and to maintain the spirit of Hajj afterwards, for those who enroll there, so that after returning from Hajj, they can stay connected with other pilgrims or even some close family members who have not performed Hajj – do you think that would be beneficial for people? For regular reminders, sharing memories, and maintaining the spirit, or would it actually create more noise in life?\nShamima Ara Leera: No, one must try. What I think is that we tend to get lost. I mean, it is said, isn't it, that you must try to stay with good people, you must try to mingle with righteous servants. Now, if you don't try, it won't happen. So, it's our responsibility. Whether it's beneficial for someone or not, I think one should try. Perhaps out of ten, one or two, whatever it is, even from that, a change will come. Change is needed.\nMuhammad: And sister, finally, let me end with one thing. We are thinking of having location-based awareness in an app for your sightseeing and exploration in Mecca and Medina. So, for example, if you are in Aziziah, you will be able to see what's around you.\nShamima Ara Leera: Yes, that's very good. That's very good, that's a very good idea. Because that's what happens, I mean, we don't know what's around us, or sometimes out of curiosity, we waste unnecessary time on other things. Apart from that, people don't always want that. It should be a part of life.\nMuhammad: Sister, if there's an app like this that actually guides you, allows you to learn lessons, allows for location-based location sharing, provides you with some logistics, and lets you know what's around you. Plus, let's say there's a mini social network in between where you can communicate with your peers and share locations. Do you think people would be interested in buying a subscription, a lifetime subscription, for such an app, or would it be better if it were free?\nShamima Ara Leera: This...\nShamima Ara Leera: A lifetime subscription actually means...\nMuhammad: I mean, a one-time payment. If you make a one-time payment, you can perform multiple Hajjs for one year, then you made multiple payments, or if you pay once, for a year, you get all the Hajj and Umrah details, and then you become a member of it. Something like that. Do you think this would add value for people?\nShamima Ara Leera: Yes, it would add value. But regarding the subscription, it's difficult to say what the business model would be. Because it depends on the class of people it focuses on. But I think you can consider your model, your business model, like maybe one month free or some beta version, and then after one month, they pay once for a year.\nMuhammad: I understand. So, if it's like that, you would use it, right?\nShamima Ara Leera: Yes.\nMuhammad: In this case, sister, how much would you be willing to pay, at most, for such an app?\nShamima Ara Leera: I think 500, for one year.\nMuhammad: I didn't understand, sister.\nShamima Ara Leera: For one year, I think 500, it could be something like that.\nMuhammad: I understand, sister. Okay, sister, these were mainly the questions for today. Sister, thank you very much for giving us your time. May Allah grant you the reward of two Mabrur Hajjs, as you have performed Hajj twice, and may He make this Hajj a means for you to enter Jannah-tul-Firdaus al-A'la, Insha'Allah. Please pray for us, we are working to make the Hajj and Umrah journey easier for people, help us do something that is beneficial for people.\nShamima Ara Leera: Okay, Insha'Allah. Alright.\nMuhammad: Okay, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: I was doing some research on vehicles and business research, that's why I'm talking to you. I'll use the information you provide for my research work, so I'll talk to you about this, Inshallah. I'll probably talk for about 20 minutes, and I might record these conversations, no problem, right? Inshallah.\nSolaimin: No, no problem at all.\nMuhammad: Okay, brother, let me start. Bismillah Ala Rasulillah. Brother, you've been in the driving profession in Makkah and Madinah for a long time. We've interviewed many Hajj pilgrims here, and many have said that getting a car is a big problem. They find that after they take a car, they don't understand the fare. Also, in Madinah, you can use Uber via mobile apps, but Makkah doesn't have this facility. So, what should pilgrims do if they are new to Makkah and come on their own without an agency, to get a car or resolve this problem?\nSolaimin: Brother, I have a transport business, Inshallah, if they take my transport in Makkah and Madinah, I will provide it, Inshallah. Look, I work with almost 40 agencies. For example, we have Shepart, Sky Holidays, and Ababil; many agencies take cars from me. I try my best to provide service, please. And look, the thing is, you have to be calm, brother. When people go to another country, they need to be calm. If they're not calm, it won't work. They need to be patient. Look, you've been to Makkah and Madinah many times. A 10-minute journey can take half an hour there. Understood? Pilgrims need to be a bit patient with this. And secondly, all my transport staff are Bengali. There are also others, Pakistanis, so understanding the language is very difficult. May Allah bless you for performing Hajj in this country. You will come again.\nSolaimin: Please, but these things must be looked at, and people need to be calm above all. If you are not calm, I can provide all the transport you need in Makkah and Madinah, do you understand?\nMuhammad: Yes, yes, brother, yes.\nSolaimin: If you want transport, I can provide it. Look, when you came with that group, they used my transport, didn't they?\nMuhammad: Yes.\nSolaimin: I had no problem.\nMuhammad: No.\nSolaimin: If you do anything about this, you can take my transport in Makkah and Madinah; there will be no problem for the pilgrims, right from Jeddah Airport to Makkah, Makkah Ziyarah, Taif, then Madinah, and for those going to Madinah Airport, there will be no problem, Inshallah.\nMuhammad: Okay, brother, tell me one thing. We've seen that Uber service is very popular in Madinah. Now, since you are in the transport business in Makkah, is there any service like Uber in Makkah where pilgrims can book in advance using an app with a calendar, without needing to call or having any hassle, just booking through a mobile app, like the ones available on Uber now?\nSolaimin: It's not like that on Uber. Uber is a Saudi thing, understand? The problem is with the language. If one can make them understand, then there would be no problem, but if they cannot be made to understand, then there is a problem.\nMuhammad: Okay, Solaiman brother, how many pilgrims do you serve per month, approximately?\nSolaimin: This month, I have 113 bookings, so one booking might have eight to ten family members.\nMuhammad: Hmm, I understand. Now, when the matter is\nSolaimin: For example, today I finished a job.\nMuhammad: So, about 10 people per booking.\nSolaimin: They came from Makkah to Madinah, and then after doing the Ziyarah, I brought the pilgrims from the airport like this.\nMuhammad: Okay, I understand, Solaiman brother. Now, those who provide transport, they also need guides. For example, when pilgrims go to Taif or perform Ziyarah, it happens that\nSolaimin: You will need a guide.\nMuhammad: Do I have a guide?\nSolaimin: There are Hujurs here, university students who come here to study.\nMuhammad: They are also there, and then we have other scholars here.\nSolaimin: Hmm.\nMuhammad: And I am also there, because for me, most agencies don't need a guide. But if you need a guide, there are students from the university here, they are also available, if you pay them, they come.\nSolaimin: I understand. Now, brother, do you only provide service to Bengalis, or also to Pakistanis or anyone who knows English, if they want to come?\nMuhammad: I provide service to people from all countries. Yesterday, I took 11 Indonesians to Taif. Okay, so for Indonesians, you mean?\nSolaimin: How did these Indonesian pilgrims contact you? How did they find you? Did you just give them a card?\nMuhammad: Yes, they contacted through someone. When the service is good, our transfers/transport are taken.\nSolaimin: Okay, I understand, Solaiman brother. When agencies hire you, the money you receive from the agency, do the agencies charge the pilgrims the same amount? Or do agencies also make some profit on top of that?\nMuhammad: Many do, many don't. You see? Everyone takes more or less.\nSolaimin: Okay.\nMuhammad: Do you understand what I'm saying?\nSolaimin: Yes, I understand, I understand. Now, Solaiman brother, what we are thinking is that we will create a website. The website will have your number, your guide. Then, for example, when someone comes there, there will be a calendar. What you will do is, you will mark all your bookings on the calendar, indicating which days are booked and which days you are free. When people book there, you will receive a notification on your mobile, not calls, but through a mobile app. Will you be able to provide service and communicate Inshallah if it's like that?\nMuhammad: That's available, I don't understand. If someone tells me that I will be given so many clips, this and that, then it works for me like that, but it doesn't usually work by looking at it like this.\nSolaimin: I understand. And regarding payments, do you always take an advance, or is it okay for you if pilgrims pay in cash after the trip is over?\nMuhammad: For you, I will prepare all the vouchers at the end.\nSolaimin: Okay.\nMuhammad: Or if you say that I sent this pilgrim, I will pay the bill at the very end.\nSolaimin: I understand, pilgrims can pay then, or if they pay in advance, that's also fine, yes, I understand, okay.\nMuhammad: There's no problem with that. Since he has come for Hajj, he hasn't come to steal my money.\nSolaimin: Yes.\nMuhammad: He will pay the money.\nSolaimin: Hmm.\nMuhammad: Maybe he'll pay at the end, or if he says he'll pay in a certain way, whatever he says, no problem. We are people from Bangladesh.\nSolaimin: I understand. Okay, Solaiman brother, what about Nusuk now? Nusuk has implemented a system. Is transport required to be taken through Nusuk, or can it be taken without Nusuk? What is the rule actually?\nMuhammad: No, no, with Nusuk, for example, I have three cars registered with Nusuk. Today, I took three trips from Madinah Airport: one at 7:00, one at 10:00, and one at 12:00.\nSolaimin: Okay.\nMuhammad: I took three trips with Nusuk.\nSolaimin: Okay, so you can provide trips through Nusuk, and if someone wants to book you through Nusuk, they can, right? Inshallah.\nMuhammad: I will provide all documents. He will send me the documents, and I will be there.\nMuhammad: Okay, Solaiman brother, perhaps we have developed a business relationship. We know you through Saleh Bhai. We have trust in you. Now, when pilgrims want to come, they usually want to see some documents or something, like, \"What are the driver's documents? What's his identity? What's his card?\" Is this a problem for you, or do most people work based on word of mouth?\nSolaimin: No, no, everyone works on word of mouth. And if they want documents, I will provide them, what's the problem?\nMuhammad: You won't be able to provide that. You can show booking details or something related to the airport.\nSolaimin: I will give everything. My license, Iqama, my car documents, everything. What's his problem? He will have to give me his passport and ticket.\nMuhammad: If he takes mine, he has to give me his.\nSolaimin: Hmm, hmm, absolutely, absolutely.\nMuhammad: Right, brother?\nSolaimin: Hmm, I understand.\nMuhammad: Okay, okay, brother, I understand. Inshallah, then the rule. So, Solaiman brother, what we are trying to do here, Inshallah, is that perhaps we can have two models. If we want to do business with you, one model could be, for example, that we provide you with some pilgrims, some trips, and these pilgrims will travel in your cars, and perhaps we will take a small commission on each pilgrim. Another model could be that we give you all the trips, and the pilgrims pay all the money to you, but for our platform, you might have to pay a small monthly fee. Now, which model would be better for you, if it's like this?\nMuhammad: This is like, for us, you want to have some profit, otherwise why would you give it to someone, listen, brother, it's about profit.\nSolaimin: Now, what happened to me is, you said like a step-by-step process, those things are a bit tough.\nMuhammad: Need to know a lot of English.\nSolaimin: And if you give us directly like this, I will give you what your profit is, and I will take what is mine.\nMuhammad: I understand.\nDriver Solaimin: Is that okay, brother?\nMuhammad: Yes, so now if I send a pilgrim, say I send a pilgrim who doesn't speak Bengali, or perhaps speaks Urdu or English, what would happen in that case? Would they speak directly with our drivers? [There are] my people of any language, any language.\nSolaimin: Speak English language.\nMuhammad: I understand, and then the driver will talk to them and communicate everything, right?\nSolaimin: Look, for English speakers, we provide an English-speaking driver; for Arabic speakers, an Arabic-speaking driver. Those of us who know Arabic, we know Arabic. We may know less English. I have three people whom I keep for English.\nMuhammad: You understand, you have to keep people everywhere.\nSolaimin: Otherwise, you can't do business.\nMuhammad: I understand, fees everywhere like this.\nSolaimin: Inshallah, there will be no problem if you want to do business, you will not have any problems moving forward.\nMuhammad: Okay, I understand, brother. Actually, brother, let me ask one last question and finish, Inshallah. It is, typically, when agencies do business with you, what percentage of profit do agencies make per 100, or if we do it, what percentage of profit could we make that would be affordable for pilgrims, meaning it wouldn't be too difficult for them, it would be easy for them?\nSolaimin: Listen, agencies make a lot of profit from one pilgrim, brother.\nMuhammad: If you talk about agencies.\nSolaimin: Just tell me.\nMuhammad: For me, look, getting 40% to 50% from one person's work is enough.\nSolaimin: Okay.\nMuhammad: No need to take more than that.\nSolaimin: I understand.\nMuhammad: For me, it's not good to harm him, nor to harm myself. No one will live forever in this world. For me, it's about sacrifice. Limited, so that he also lives, and I also live. I think it's better if we just keep going. Okay, brother, what if a pilgrim contacts you directly? If you charge him 100 taka, and if we have a business agreement with you, then Inshallah, you can give us some discounted rates, right?\nSolaimin: Of course, I will give a discount, and if you say how much you will take from 100 taka, you will get 20% from 100 taka if you give us pilgrims.\nMuhammad: I understand.\nSolaimin: Referral fee, I understand.\nMuhammad: Okay, brother, okay, brother, it was good talking to you. We will contact you further, Inshallah. What we are doing, Inshallah, is addressing a big complaint of pilgrims in Makkah and Madinah: there are no guides. They don't understand where to go or what to do.\nSolaimin: If you need a guide, we will provide a guide, no problem. You can give us two or three trips to see how our service is. If you like it, brother, then give it to us.\nMuhammad: No, I went with you. Alhamdulillah, your service is very good. That's why I'm talking to you. I myself went with you. I went to Taif, Alhamdulillah. Then I went for Makkah Ziyarah. Brother, do you have drivers in Madinah too, or only in Makkah?\nSolaimin: I am everywhere, I am in Madinah now. Today I prayed Jumu'ah in Madinah. I am talking to you from Madinah.\nMuhammad: Alhamdulillah, that's good.\nSolaimin: I have cars on both sides. So, you take care. Prayers for you.\nMuhammad: So, Solaiman brother, one last thing before I finish. Since you are in Madinah, at the time of Asr on Friday, please make a special prayer for me. So that I can serve the pilgrims like you. I am trying to move forward with this. Please pray for me.\nSolaimin: Inshallah. I pray for you. May you Inshallah come and serve the esteemed pilgrims. Inshallah, I pray for you. Stay well, stay healthy. Allah Hafiz. Assalamu Alaikum.\nMuhammad: Wa Alaikum Assalam."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: If you could share which year you performed Hajj, then we can start, insha'Allah. Could you please repeat? First, please introduce yourself, and if you could share which year you performed Hajj or Umrah, we can start with that.\nTahmeed Sharif: I am currently the founder of [brown dike - inaudible/best guess: probably a company name like Brown Dike, or it could be \"brown diggi\"], I am a software engineer previously. I performed Hajj in 2024.\nMuhammad: Okay, your voice is breaking up a bit. Maybe a better microphone would help.\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, brother, can you hear me now?\nMuhammad: Now the sound is a bit.\nTahmeed Sharif: Okay, brother, is the audio better now?\nMuhammad: Yes, much better now, Alhamdulillah.\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, brother, I performed Hajj in 2024.\nMuhammad: How many days was your Hajj journey, and how did you choose your agency?\nTahmeed Sharif: My journey was 40 days. And regarding choosing, when I was in software, a brother shared a Facebook post about it. I saw it there, and then he suggested registering while there was still time. So after he shared his experience with me, I then decided to register there. After that, I got ideas about that agency from many other people. Mainly, one criterion was that they perform everything according to authentic Sunnah and have a good guide. For example, we had Sheikh Doctor there. That was a big plus point. So I mainly chose based on this. Mainly, being able to perform Hajj under a good scholar.\nMuhammad: So you had two points here. One was referral, and the other was strong guidance, based on which you chose this agency, right? Okay, so when you prepared for Hajj, in terms of logistics, and how you would do the dos and don'ts of Hajj that are not related to worship, such logistics, and the rules and rituals related to worship, what was your preparation method like? Because the medium through which you performed Hajj, they were based in Dhaka, and you were in Chittagong, so was that a challenge for you?\nTahmeed Sharif: It was a challenge initially, even for submitting my documents, especially during Ramadan. And I later found out that their Chittagong partners were [Gojiyara - inaudible/best guess: Goziara], their Chittagong partner. I could have given them the documents earlier perhaps. That information was given to me later. So if they had given me this information earlier, it might have been a bit easier for me because going to Dhaka during Ramadan to submit the documents was a bit challenging for me. And since many people from Chittagong go through Shepherds, they could have perhaps organized some get-togethers or events in Chittagong, at least some. I see they are doing it from this year, but they didn't have time before.\nMuhammad: I see. In terms of training, they conducted live classes, and you participated in those online, right?\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, online.\nMuhammad: So, do you think these classes were effective for you?\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, the classes were effective, but I think they could have been a bit more interactive.\nMuhammad: You work a lot with learning management solutions, Alhamdulillah. As an entrepreneur, your main specialty is learning management, so could you share some ideas? How do you think the learning journey can be made more interactive and effective? Yes, I think it could be made a bit more digital. For example, government-wise, this data is kept on a dashboard, and agencies also have a dashboard, as far as I know. So if such a system is arranged for pilgrims, and related resources are provided through it, and there's an option to give courses, and maybe some mandatory prerequisites could also be given by the government or through agencies. And question-answer MCQs can be provided. Then I think everyone can be better prepared. And for example, when we registered on the Nusuk app in Saudi Arabia, they actually provide many rules and regulations through their app, from which many scholars teach. I think something similar can be implemented in Bangladesh, where all of them are in English or Arabic. Do you think having it in Bengali would be convenient for you? Let me share something with you, you have used the Duolingo app to learn English. What if we follow the Duolingo model here? Like Duolingo, there would be some bite-sized content, and then quizzes and some interactive games where you could learn things interactively. Do you think this would be beneficial?\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, I think this would be beneficial because currently, people's attention spans are very short. So, if large courses of two, three, or four hours are given, it might be difficult for many to follow. So, small, interactive courses would be easier and would stick in their minds better. And I also think that if someone learns some Arabic phrases beforehand, it makes moving around there much easier for everyone. Because there is a language barrier there. Not everyone, especially the staff or management, can speak English well.\nMuhammad: Okay, in that case, for English, what we are doing is using a translator. So, when you use Google Translate, you can speak, and another person can also speak in translation mode. And in that case, their words are live-transcribed for you, and your words are live-transcribed for them. But if you notice, the new AI bots from Google, they all use conversational APIs to talk to you. Now, what if you go to a shop, you buy something, and then through the same app, or you directly say, \"I need help with this thing,\" then the conversational API takes your input, converses with the shopkeeper, and completes your transaction according to the price you offered, acting as an AI agent, a live translator? What kind of idea do you think this is?\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, this is definitely a very good idea. This will make the Hajj experience much easier for people, Insha'Allah, if it can be implemented.\nMuhammad: Next, regarding our journey, we understand that for learning, instead of long lessons, there can be bite-sized durations, and in that case, there can be interactive quiz modules so that people can gain a comprehensive understanding of logistics and rituals, and make it easier. Then you mentioned that having a translate agent would make communication much easier. Next is the logistics on the day of Hajj, for instance, upon arrival, you might have to perform Umrah, buy a SIM card, and there's the airport journey. What challenges did you face in these areas?\nTahmeed Sharif: There's a challenge regarding buying a SIM card, where to buy it from. For example, in my case, my phone did not support a physical SIM, it only supported an e-SIM. So, it seemed like where I was going, they could not give me instructions on where to get it from. Later, I found the direct customer care and got it from there. And even there, initially, they didn't understand what my requirement was. And secondly, when it came to recharging it after its validity expired, I was in Aziziyah, where there weren't many opportunities to recharge. Later, I did it online through an online payment, which incurs a bit more charge. So, perhaps this process could be simplified a bit.\nMuhammad: For this, what if you could buy a prepaid SIM connection through an app upon arriving there, for the first week or three days, or you could use roaming from your local operators like Grameenphone or Robi from Bangladesh, so that your communication doesn't break down for the first few days? And then you understand and can buy a SIM, and it tells you to go to this place, Sofikar, and these types of packages are available, and you can buy them. Do you think this would be beneficial?\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, I think it would be beneficial. Mainly, the guidelines, meaning where I can get it from, or at least initially, I don't have to worry that I won't be able to communicate, or that I couldn't get a SIM, if that could be arranged.\nMuhammad: Okay, now let's talk about the requirements for Hajj and Umrah. When you went for Umrah, many duas (supplications) are recited according to the Sunnah, there are many Sunnah duas, many mandatory duas, and many steps. Did you remember all of these, or did you carry a book with you when you went?\nTahmeed Sharif: I carried a book with me.\nMuhammad: Do you think it would be convenient if, instead of a book, there was a mobile app where all the duas were beautifully presented?\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, I think so. I think Nusuk might have had something similar. So, it would be very convenient if it were in an app. Next are the logistics after Hajj. For example, people spend a long time during Hajj, like 40 days. In this case, if there was a theme for everyone's Hajj, like how many days you would stay after Umrah, say 15, 20, or 40 days, and then a learning path would be created for this. For instance, you could take classes on the Quran or learn. And during that time, you could utilize your time well. If there was a learning platform so that you could utilize your Hajj time even better, do you think this would be beneficial? And this can actually be done easily, there's no need for a separate business. Yes, it could be beneficial. However, physically, there are many talks there in different languages from different countries, and I didn't know this initially. I found out later. So, in that case, maybe this could also be conveyed through an app.\nMuhammad: Hello.\nTahmeed Sharif: Hello, hello brother, can you hear me? Assalamu Alaikum brother. Brother, I was listening to you. My voice is being picked up by Zoom here. Can you hear me? Hello, hello brother, can you hear me?\nMuhammad: I can hear you. You are saying that if there's information on where classes are happening or what events are taking place through this type of app, people can know live better, and another thing is.\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, brother, another thing is, for example, there are Quran classes there, meaning classes where people recite directly to scholars and get feedback, in both Haramain. So, in that case, it might be possible to do registration or know where it's happening, or where it's good for Bangladeshis to go, if these instructions are available through an app, I think the experience would be better, since we are going to a place where I can interact more with the people of that country through this.\nMuhammad: Learning from scholars. Here it is like this, information is very crucial in our time. When you go to [Chiara - inaudible/best guess: Ziyarat places], what is the significance of a place, what is its location, then what activities are happening in Masjid Nabawi, where is the library in Makkah, where are the programs, where is Zamzam actually located? If these are shown through an interactive map, and you can learn their stories, and live events are also available, do you think this would be valuable for people?\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, brother, I think this would be very valuable, Insha'Allah.\nMuhammad: Now let's talk about the logistics on the day of Hajj. What were the logistics like for you on the day of Hajj, like movement, getting to places by car? It was very difficult on the day of Hajj, and there were problems getting buses. Cars were not available, and even if they were, the prices were very expensive. Where it should have been 10 Riyals, it would be 300-400 Riyals. So, I think this is a big challenge for pilgrims. In this situation, pilgrims actually help each other and share information with each other. So, for this, if you think there was a crowdsourced portal or a specific social network where all pilgrims could join, see the location of other pilgrims near them, talk to each other, send messages like \"I'm going from this point to that point, how much might a taxi cost here?\" or if there was a live program where people could communicate, do you think this would be beneficial and people would actively participate?\nTahmeed Sharif: I think if it is controlled by the government, it would be more effective. If there is very strict monitoring from the government that if someone charges 500 Riyals for a 10 Riyal fare, it would be... you understand what I'm saying? I'm saying that there will be no fare monitoring here, but there will be a communication layer. Like on Facebook, we communicate in groups, somewhat like that. Here, within the app I mentioned, pilgrims can communicate with other nearby pilgrims. For example, if you were in Aziziyah and you want to come from Aziziyah to Makkah, to Haram Sharif, then if you message everyone there asking what the fare is from Aziziyah to Makkah Sharif, or if you can go by bus from here. So, there would also be information about transportation, which would be knowledge-based, and agents could answer such questions. And meanwhile, if there is peer-to-peer messaging communication with peers around you, do you think this would be effective?\nTahmeed Sharif: I think that's what I was answering. My point was that if it's done by people, I personally don't think it would be very effective. If it's enforced by the government, if the government states that the price from here to here is like this, or if the instructions are given and enforced by the government, then it would be more effective. More so than if people say it.\nMuhammad: You feel that if it's not decentralized but a centralized system?\nTahmeed Sharif: Centralized.\nMuhammad: Okay, what if the government is not involved, and nothing is imposed, only information is shared? For example, you know that the fare from here to here is 15 Riyals, and during the season, it can be up to 30 Riyals. Then maybe you could negotiate accordingly. Do you think this would add any benefit, or would it just solve itself? It doesn't add benefit. I'm not sure if it would add benefit. Next, regarding your movement, it's often seen that roads are almost always closed in Saudi Arabia, and then there's a lot of quick rerouting. In that case, do you think it would be helpful if people could help each other by showing traffic alerts or road closures through location sharing on Google Maps, showing which way traffic is moving, for personal use?\nTahmeed Sharif: Yes, brother, in this case, a crowd-sourcing app could be very useful. Because I encountered many situations. In those cases, it could be useful.\nMuhammad: Do you think people would actively participate here?\nTahmeed Sharif: Maybe not everyone would. Perhaps they might, or they might not. Since it's Hajj time, it might. Many might not have it on their minds. But those who need it might. Okay, so we're moving on. Your networks during Hajj, you have many during Hajj. During Muzdalifah, Arafah, we face challenges. These, you feel, are an expensive experience during Hajj, like Mina and Arafah. How do you think these challenges can be topped through an app? I know, fine, let's ask the next question. This is what happens a lot during Hajj, when people visit various locations, shopping, buying food from food courts, and finding places during Ziyarat. Were these challenging for you beforehand?\nTahmeed Sharif: These were relatively easy for me, and I didn't eat much at the food court, no problem.\nMuhammad: Do you think it would be beneficial if an app contained information like where you can find good attractions, or good markets, or where you can find good food, or information about various locations like the plots in Taif? For example, when you visit Masjid Abbas, its significance, or when you visit the garden where many companions, Radiyallahu Anhum, are buried, its significance. Or when you visit Masjid Quba in Madinah, its great significance. If there was content with the significance of such spots, would you find it valuable for yourself? If the significances are included, I think it would be beneficial for the pilgrims, especially if it includes historical aspects or what is found in the Quran and Sunnah. Next, we talk about life after Hajj. After returning from Hajj, if there was an app to help you maintain the spirit of Hajj in your lifestyle, where your Hajj memories come back, staying connected with those who performed Hajj with you, and sharing various Hajj cities with them? If there was such an app, like a mini social networking app but focused on Hajj, would you use it? Because perhaps it can be done for some reason. Finally, the question I asked you, what I understood from everyone's conversation is that educational content would be very good for you. Would you be willing to pay only for using educational content, or what would be better for you in that case?\nTahmeed Sharif: Brother, I personally would not pay, because normally people don't always go. Since it's almost a once-in-a-lifetime journey for most people, I don't think paying for this would be very pocket-friendly. And people are already spending so much money for Hajj. It could be like a partnership with agencies. However, I think this matter is a correction. If you intend to perform Umrah again in the future, Insha'Allah, you might have previous experience. Would you go with an agency, or would you try to perform Umrah on your own initiative? If I go for Umrah, I might try to go on my own. If you want to go on your own, then in that case, hotel booking, taxis, and guidance for such logistics, if those are available for you. Thank you, these were all your questions for today. Thank you very much for your valuable time and cooperation. May Allah accept your Hajj and grant you the ability to perform Hajj, Insha'Allah. We will update you on our progress, Insha'Allah, Assalamu Alaikum.\nMuhammad: Wa Alaikum Assalam."

    "english_transcript": "[00:00] Muhammad: Brother, why? Can you hear me? Brother, your mic is muted.\n[00:01] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Wa alaikum assalam. I can hear and see you. I'm completing the program. So, they help and guide young entrepreneurs. And there's a one-week workshop where they teach participants about what a startup is, what venture capital is. And then each of them is asked to do a startup thesis, like if I want to work in this industry, how would I work? My industry was the Hajj and Umrah industry. So, a part of this is to interview all the affiliated stakeholders in the Hajj and Umrah industry – pilgrims, Hajj-Umrah operators, and service providers. So, I have to interview around 30 people. I felt that you are a person, Alhamdulillah, who has performed Hajj, and you are now starting your Umrah trips. If I interview you, Inshallah, I will be able to gather some good insights. So, this is why we have this call, and Inshallah, if you permit, I will record it, but I will not share it publicly with anyone. It will just be used for research purposes with Hassan. Is there any problem with recording?\n[00:59] Muhammad: No, it's fine, it's fine. So, brother, let's start formally. Could you please share a bit about your agency's name, which is Tasbih Hajj and Umrah Agency, and you are the sole proprietor of the agency, right? Inshallah. And you started this business in 2023. So, you are doing Umrah trips through your own connections, and for Hajj, you are working together with partners. Okay, so now please share a bit about the Hajj packages you usually offer, whose prices vary from 6 lakh Taka up to 12 lakh Taka, with multiple types of packages. Please tell me about your Umrah packages: what types of packages you have, like economy, mid-range, premium, what are the pricing segments, and which packages are more popular, which types of packages do people prefer to go for?\n[02:07] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Okay, thank you for including me in this session and for arranging such a meeting. So, I started Tasbih Hajj Umrah in 2023. And now, regarding the Umrah trips we operate, it's seen that the requirements actually come according to the customer segment. In the segment I work in, I've observed that I have more premium customers. The packages I usually handle are 5-star and 4-star packages, and about 80% of my pilgrims for Umrah, those who take 5-star and 4-star packages, their package prices range from around 2 lakh to 2 lakh 20-30 Taka, something like 2 lakh to 2 lakh 20 Taka. As for group packages, economy packages are more popular. We usually offer economy packages for around 1 lakh 40-45 thousand Taka, including food. This is what most common people take, those who are financially in the mid-range or who don't have a lot of money but have the desire to perform Umrah or to see the House of Allah, the Kaaba. They tend to go for these packages. So, from the mid-range, I've seen that this range goes to the lower range, 1 lakh 40-45 thousand Taka at an economic rate, or else, the majority of my customers opt for the 5-star, 4-star packages, which are around 2 lakh Taka.\n[03:41] Muhammad: Okay, the ones that go for 5-star, 4-star, those are customized packages, right?\n[03:45] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Right, right.\n[03:46] Muhammad: So, Azad Bhai, could you please update me on how many customized packages you do in a year and how many group packages you do? If I say, I don't have the exact numbers like that yet. My total numbers are calculated, but not by range. So, I can assume, for example, if I send a total of 100 people in a year – since I'm just starting out, if I send 100, about 80 of them are going for the star packages, customized. The economy packages are very few. And do you do this alone, or do you work with other agencies for customized packages?\n[04:22] Wayes Kuruni Azad: I do it with an agency. My younger brother has a separate agency; I do the packages through him. And even the economy packages, we both send them together. What happens is that the service he provides, which I've done here, even though it's being recorded, I have to say that the reviews we get from the customers we send through him are better compared to sending them with other agencies, and we can offer better rates. This is because my younger brother can directly purchase hotels from the hotels themselves, and we have our own login site from which we buy hotels. That's why we can offer competitive rates, as we don't buy hotels through any third party; we buy directly from the hotel owners or authorities. Another thing is that it's possible to provide service exactly as desired. And his quality, the transparency, trust, and belief he has – it doesn't leave any room for doubt that he handles my clients differently, even though his agency name is different, which I won't mention here. He goes to Makkah and Madinah more often because I have family issues, so I go less. Even when he goes, the service is such that in any situation, for example, if a customer suddenly has an issue or a problem, we respond immediately. More than how much we can solve, if we show sympathy and empathy to the customer and try to solve the problem, customers give very good feedback and reviews. For economy packages, even those who go for 1 lakh 40 thousand to 1 lakh 45 thousand Taka, they also consider it very expensive and high-cost, and their expectations are very high. But we inform them beforehand that it's an economy package, the hotels will be like this, you won't get water here, you'll have to bring your own plates and glasses, etc. Even after this, when their expectations rise after arriving, we tell them the situation, and to the extent possible, in some cases, we provide incentives or solve things in such a way that they are satisfied with our service. I've seen that customer response is very important. If the response is proper and timely, it's possible to get better reviews for Umrah. Although it's challenging, I've seen it's possible.\n[06:56] Muhammad: You made a very good point here about maintaining proper communication with the customer. Understanding the customer's pulse and getting feedback from them. Yes, how challenging is it for you to do this? What challenges do you face in doing these tasks?\n[07:11] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, the first challenge is the financial issue. For example, when I offer a package with direct flights, after deducting visa costs, flight costs, and transport costs, there isn't much left for hotel costs; the margin is very low. The margin is so low economically that it's not always possible to fulfill customer expectations by increasing the budget from here. But we are trying, or rather, we try to add small corrections, investments, or incentives within the package's standard, which greatly helps or contributes to getting good reviews. So, the challenge, in this case, is actually the financial challenge, which is important. Because you can't improve the hotel quality in these packages even if you want to, because hotel quality is an issue. And if your regular guides are responsive, and an important aspect of a guide is that you can't manage service with borrowed people, because they don't want to put in their physical effort or hard work in that way. If you hire someone, it's seen that when the owner or proprietor or partner goes himself, it's possible to maintain good service and focus. And sometimes, even beyond capacity, their focus is still on getting a better review. If you always keep in mind that you need to get a better review from your customers, no matter what they say – you know some customers are a bit hard or difficult; not everyone is the same. You will find some customers or pilgrims who are truly difficult. So, if you keep them in mind that you need to get a better review from them, and if your goal is always like this throughout the entire journey, then you can overcome this challenge. Your focus must always be on getting better from every [best guess: angle].\n[09:20] Muhammad: So, brother, I have a question here. You said that your partner goes himself, and you also mentioned that most of your packages are customized. Customized packages happen sporadically throughout the year. For example, if I want to go today, you would create a customized package for me. But it's not possible for one person to go with everyone throughout the year. So, for instance, if I go now, or a premium customer comes to you a week later, they prefer to have very good guidance. And there will be someone who can continuously talk to them. How do you solve this challenge then? In that case...\n[10:11] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Yes, for that, we have a separate setup. For example, even within my five-star packages, for customized packages, whether two people, four, six, eight, or ten people go, we don't have any problem. We've arranged some special things for two people there. For example, if someone wants meet-and-assist service, we tell them that for additional meet-and-assist service, we have people, and it will cost 200 Saudi Riyals in Makkah, and 200 Saudi Riyals in Madinah. If they want guidance or an Imam (Alem), we also have a setup for guide Imams there; if they want, we can provide them, and that will cost 200 Saudi Riyals. After that, for example, if you want a Ziyarah guide, if that's the case for a guide, then if you want, we have additional setup there, we can provide it, and that will also cost an additional 200. So, we've kept this as a paid version. Whoever needs it will take it, whoever doesn't need it won't. This way, we can offer a competitive price to the customer, because these are not added to the basic price. Also, we can openly say that you can get this service if you want, and if you don't want this service, it's not included in the basic package price. If you take additional services outside the basic package, we can provide it, but it's a paid version.\n[11:39] Muhammad: In this case, when you take services from third-party agents in Makkah and Madinah, like drivers, meet-and-greet guides, and food providers, do you take a commission from them, or do you just take their direct payment from the customer and pass it on? Do you make any profit here?\n[11:51] Wayes Kuruni Azad: It varies case by case. For example, when the margin is low in our basic package for a customer, in some specific cases, like when we get a good scholar (Alem), it costs us exactly 200 Riyals, and we charge 200 Riyals. So, we can't keep any margin there. However, for meet-and-assist, it might be possible to complete it for 150 Riyals even if we charge 200 Riyals. In that case, we have about 50 Riyals left. This is not for profit, because 50 Riyals is not really a margin at all. In some cases, we even tell pilgrim customers that we are giving meet-and-assist as a compliment. In such situations, if we try to make a margin here, customers might find out from other agencies later, which creates bigger problems. So, in that case, I would say it's better not to seek a margin here. Because, as you know, this business is entirely about relationships and networks. And the more you sacrifice for them, the more your reputation and goodwill will expand.\n[13:06] Muhammad: Okay, let me share something here. The busiest months for Hajj and Umrah are Ramadan and December, right? During these times, when a huge volume of customers go, do you still get these services uninterrupted, or does managing these services become very challenging?\n[13:30] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, of course, they become challenging. Because at that time, when there's a crowd, a big crowd, prices also increase, and at the same time, services are not readily available there. And hotel services, transport services, these experience some disruption. This is a reality, it's not always possible to manage. However, what we do is we inform the customers beforehand. We conduct a training session before they go. So, what happens is that when they become aware, they are mentally prepared that there are such challenges here. So, it seems that if we communicate this to the customers in advance, the customers understand much of the problem, realizing that there's nothing we can do; they just adjust.\n[14:30] Muhammad: Okay, so, brother, price adjustment is a very big challenge here. So, in terms of price adjustment, what is your biggest overall challenge, and on average, if you're comfortable sharing a range, what kind of margin do you keep for your economy packages, and what kind of margin do you keep for premium packages?\n[14:55] Wayes Kuruni Azad: It actually varies. For economy packages, the profit is around three, five, six, five to six thousand Taka.\n[15:06] Muhammad: Is that 3,000 per lakh, or 3,000-5,000 for the whole 1.5 lakh?\n[15:10] Wayes Kuruni Azad: For the whole 1.5 lakh, there's actually not more than 5,000 Taka per lakh. Because, as we are a new business, our focus has to be on service. Since we are in the initial phase, we are not focused on profit; we are mostly focused on service. And for premium packages, we can fit about 10-15 thousand, 12-15 thousand Taka per package. So, we see that premium service can be provided well, premium reviews are good, and good margins are also obtained from premium.\n[15:58] Muhammad: So, if I consider premium, you're saying on average your premium package prices are around 2 to 2.5 lakh Taka. Right? If I even consider 10 to 15 thousand Taka, your profit is not more than 5 to 6%. Okay, so after this 5 to 6% profit, do your operational costs, including your executive salaries, actually make this sustainable for you, or are you doing this just to build up your business?\n[16:32] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, this whole thing depends on volume. If you aim for a high margin in this business, it will be difficult to attract customers. Secondly, if you consider the margin, let's say I keep the market price; you see, economy packages are like 1.40-1.45 (lakh) in the market. But if I reduce the quality of service to increase the margin, then my future business will be impacted. So, it's not like we're just taking anyone at any price. We're taking a standard price that is competitive with the market, and you could say that 40-45 (thousand for economy packages) is not a small amount, because many sell for 30-35. So, we're selling for 40-45. But what we do is invest more in the customers. By investing more in customers, we are thinking that we will invest our advertisement cost, which we would spend elsewhere, here on the customers. Ultimately, we try to manage the finances that way. And what you said, it's definitely challenging that office expenses, for example, if you have a large setup and a low number of pilgrims, you won't be able to manage. You need to keep your setup small and smart, and also increase the number of pilgrims. As the number of pilgrims increases, you'll need to expand your operation team step by step. Then you can manage...\n[17:58] Muhammad: I understand. So, brother, from a customer, you usually find that people perform Hajj or Umrah more than once. Typically, from one customer, you usually get a lifetime value of about 10,000 Taka on average. Approximately, if we combine your economy package and premium package, you get 8 to 10 thousand Taka as lifetime value from a customer, right? And there...\n[18:23] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Here, I've seen that premium customers actually have a higher lifetime value. Economy ones might have lower lifetime value, but for premium, the lifetime value is higher. How? We've seen that premium customers usually don't go just once; they go repeatedly, every two years. And then there's a possibility to convert them to Hajj packages. Furthermore, there's their referrals. As you know, this business is entirely based on referrals. So, if you can provide fantastic customer service, you can get huge referrals from these customers. So, if you calculate lifetime value in that way, typically, for other products like shoes or mobile phones, referrals aren't used that much. For example, you buy shoes from a Bata showroom or Apex, or a Samsung mobile; you don't tell any customer to go to that specific store. They might buy the brand, but perhaps from another showroom. But in this Hajj business, what usually happens? Referrals refer back to you, to this agency. So, you can say that through your marketing or this, you have future business. Even if you don't get it from the direct customer, you can get it from their referrals.\n[19:57] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, so in that case, brother, if I talk about your other aspects, you have to provide a lot of premium services to customers who refer others. So, a part of this can be considered from your marketing budget. So, on an average, if you give me a very rough estimate from one customer – I know it's very tough to calculate in terms of monetary value – but hypothetically, if you get, say, 15,000 Taka as lifetime value, then to acquire that customer, considering the service provided and marketing done, what would be your customer acquisition cost?\n[20:30] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, it cannot be said like that now. Because what we are doing is, I haven't gone for large-scale advertisement yet. I only do the basic, very minimal level on my personal Facebook page or our Hajj page. I do very little advertising. The reason is, if the backward linkage isn't strong, if you can't send groups regularly on a monthly basis, then if you can't provide ample customer service, there's a chance of a negative future impact. What we believe is that without strengthening operations, we shouldn't run too far forward. We must move forward, but if the backup, the backward linkage, isn't strong, until then, if you invest too much in advertising, even if customers come, you won't be able to accommodate them. And in that case, it seems now that my investment, if I talk about the customer, might be around 1000 Taka per customer.\n[21:49] Muhammad: Okay, so your customer acquisition cost is, say, around 1 to 2 thousand Taka per [customer]?\n[21:54] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Maximum. I don't really do it like that at present.\n[21:58] Muhammad: And brother, if we think this way, for example, you were a very high official in a company in Bangladesh, and given your experience and expertise, if you wanted to hire someone like that, you would have to pay them at least, say, 2 lakh Taka salary in Bangladeshi currency. If you hire someone like that with a 2 lakh Taka salary, and you get the current volume of customers, then what would your customer acquisition cost be in that scenario?\n[22:30] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, then of course, your customer acquisition cost would be much higher. Because when you allocate the cost of such a valuable person to the entire operational cost, right now, we are actually in the investment phase, or what's called the take-off stage. In the take-off stage, it means I haven't done my full valuation here. If I did a full valuation and operated, we are currently at a break-even point, or rather, managing to break-even or just overcoming it. So, including official office expenses, utility bills, and the salary of one staff member, if you consider the acquisition cost to be, say, 2 lakh 50 thousand if I assume 100 customers, then your customer acquisition cost would actually be very high. Right now, there isn't really time to calculate that.\n[23:32] Muhammad: So, it means you are still in a trial phase with your business, testing the market for future prospects, or are you working on a model where you take direct dividends from profit? What is your model?\n[23:44] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Yes, the current model is profit-based. It's not salary-based yet.\n[23:48] Muhammad: I understand. So, you mentioned that you acquire your deals directly from hotels through your links. In this case, do you manage any sub-agents or associates?\n[23:58] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Yes, we have many sub-agents who take hotels from us. We give them to customers, and we also give them to sub-agents. But this is still very little because you won't be trusted enough to give sub-agents if you don't have a big marketing setup. So, without big operations, you won't gain that trust in such a short time. Right now, we are actually acting like sub-agents ourselves.\n[24:37] Muhammad: I understand, I understand, brother. You source many hotels. Here, talking to some people, I understood why the hotel scenario in Makkah and Madinah works like a pyramid scheme. So, the hotel sells to an agent. But as far as I've heard, to sell, it has to be a Saudi-licensed Umrah agency. Then, that agent buys from them, and then distribution happens from that agent. What is your source? Is your source directly the hotel, or a Saudi-authorized Umrah agent, from whom you buy?\n[25:12] Wayes Kuruni Azad: What we do is, for example, there's an agent for 10 Saudi hotels, like an agent for an MR Group. And then there are smaller sub-agents who deal with about 15 hotels in Makkah and Madinah. So, we get from them. It means, direct from the hotel, the direct hotel price and this hotel price... actually, they don't sell directly. Such types of people sell. You won't get it directly from the hotel. So, from such a present [agent], we can say they are first-hand. Or if not first-hand, we can say second-hand. Second-hand is the owner. After the owner is the hotel agent. So, we can mostly buy from that second-hand source.\n[26:11] Muhammad: So, it means it goes to a third party. From the hotel to one person, who is the owner, and then you buy from them. Brother, this is only possible with very strong networking. So, when you built up these networks, what strategies did you follow, and how challenging is it for someone starting now?\n[26:30] Wayes Kuruni Azad: That's challenging. Because my partner, he used to work for an agency that dealt with agents, which is why he became familiar with those hotels. So, it all happened through his personal connections, because he used to handle that company. Now, everyone knows him personally, and that's why he has that authenticity. Because if you pick just any agent, you might find that they give you hotels, but then suddenly run away with a large chunk of money.\n[27:03] Wayes Kuruni Azad: There's also that kind of risk; for example, you go to someone, and then they disappear with your money, and then all your capital and everything is gone. So, in that case, there's a risk; you can't just build relations with anyone. And also, not everyone will give you access even if you want it. For example, my partner does it, but I usually take it at the rate he buys, or we do profit-sharing. I haven't gone into [inaudible] yet. What happens is, I have never asked for or taken access from him.\n[27:49] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, so now your business is entirely dependent on your partner. But your own link hasn't been built up yet.\n[27:57] Wayes Kuruni Azad: My link is...\n[27:58] Muhammad: Okay. So, in that case, brother, you are now trying to build up your own link. So, in this case, are you following any strategy to build it up, or are you relying on your partner for now? In that case, your partner... Let me ask one thing: when you are saying you are buying these services, offering these services, buying hotels, what happens during the busy months? You get reliable service at other times, but when it's a busy month like Ramadan, does the reliability of services fluctuate then?\n[28:44] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Hmm, hmm. Then it's seen that you can't get it directly from the agent. Then you get it from a sub-agent or another agent. Actually, direct from the hotel, we can get it if we buy in December now. But we won't get it if we buy in November or around October. And for Ramadan, we won't get it the month before Ramadan, nor during Ramadan. It might be possible to get it for Ramadan if bought now or two months later. There are some issues like this. Also, rates for all hotels haven't come out yet. December rates haven't come out yet. So, these things vary, many things are related to the market, there's a backdrop to this. So, it's...\n[29:33] Muhammad: But when you procure hotels, if someone, be it an agent, sub-agent, or tertiary agent, promises you a hotel and you pay, then you don't face problems getting the service, right? Okay, after payment...\n[29:50] Wayes Kuruni Azad: After payment, I haven't faced any problems yet.\n[29:52] Muhammad: Okay. But does the same thing happen with service providers? For example, those who provide car services, bus services, guide services, are they also reliable, or do they sometimes back out?\n[30:04] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, the ones we are working with now, they are reliable.\n[30:08] Muhammad: Reliable, and this relationship has been built just by working together and building business relationships, right?\n[30:13] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Hmm hmm hmm hmm.\n[30:16] Wayes Kuruni Azad: I can't do that independently right now. That was done by my partner because he worked with agents, so he built those relationships. He did it with his capacity.\n[30:25] Muhammad: Okay. So, brother, Saudi Arabia has changed a rule recently, making it mandatory to go through Nusuk. In that case, can one buy directly through the NSK platform? Is it the case that those like you, who haven't built such connections yet, can use the Nusuk platform to buy directly from hotels and provide service to your clients?\n[30:54] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, no, what we've seen is that Nusuk actually depends on a Saudi agent. A Saudi agent works as an intermediary for Nusuk. You can't directly buy through Nusuk while sitting here. We've seen that for visas, you have to take transport from the visa company. Transport has to be taken from the visa company. A Saudi company works as an intermediary here and provides that transport. So, whether it's hotels or transport, there's a significant complexity involved now. It's not as easy as before. If someone wants to go individually now, it's challenging for them. Whereas before, people could go alone, now, in the case of individual travel, many won't want to issue visas because there's a chance of fines. We've seen that in many cases, if transport isn't taken from their authorized agency, then they might impose fines. So, there are such troubles. If the hotel isn't classified or listed, then you might also be fined. It's much tougher now.\n[32:16] Muhammad: Okay, when I say individual, I mean as an individual agency owner. If, hypothetically speaking, you didn't have your partner's link, could you directly contact Nusuk, and with an international credit card and banking channels outside Bangladesh, buy hotels at B2B rates and provide services to pilgrims? Or is this network effect still very essential for sourcing hotels and services?\n[32:41] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, for hotels, you really have to depend on an agent. Because what we have now is an Umrah license. Without a license, no one will want to make an agreement with you, brother.\n[32:51] Muhammad: Hmm.\n[32:52] Wayes Kuruni Azad: An agreement. If you don't have a license. If you don't have a Hajj license, then it's tough for you to directly contact that Saudi agency. So, you could say it's a prerequisite that you must have a license. So, from Bangladesh, their license.\n[33:10] Muhammad: Right? Ministry. Bangladesh Ministry. But if you have a Bangladesh Ministry license, then do they usually cooperate directly with you when you talk to them in Saudi Arabia?\n[33:14] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Hmm hmm hmm.\n[33:16] Muhammad: You said that because you haven't explored it yet, I understand.\n[33:20] Muhammad: Okay, so that's for you now. Okay, now let's talk about digital tooling, brother. So, I understand that you haven't explored marketing extensively yet. You have some production plans in marketing. You are managing a customer base. And you are also doing B2B rates. So, for all of this, what digital tools do you use?\n[33:46] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Facebook, WhatsApp, then website.\n[33:50] Muhammad: Okay, so given how you're currently doing marketing, if there was a tool, say, a website like ShareTrip in Bangladesh or Agoda or Booking.com abroad, and someone like them offered to buy services from you at a slightly discounted B2B rate but helped with marketing, would you be interested in that? Even if your profit margin might be lower then.\n[34:18] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Hmm, hmm, hmm. Definitely, it should be or will be. Because my business is growing.\n[34:24] Muhammad: Hmm.\n[34:25] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Even with a lower margin, my business is growing. If there's volume, then it's definitely profitable.\n[34:31] Muhammad: And in that case, what if your margin remains exactly the same, but they charge you a flat rate, a membership fee? Based on that, your packages can be advertised. Would you be interested in such a model? A flat fee-based model?\n[34:52] Wayes Kuruni Azad: I didn't understand that.\n[34:53] Muhammad: For example, you pay a flat fee of $50 or $100 per month. And in return, you can advertise as many packages as you want monthly, customize your packages, and have your own domain. Would you be interested in such a model, or what?\n[35:10] Wayes Kuruni Azad: It requires thinking. Because if our business grows on a large scale and we have our own operations, we haven't run full operations yet.\n[35:36] Muhammad: If you don't run full operations, for example, if I go with someone on a flat rate and my sales aren't confirmed...\n[35:40] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, I mean, a flat fee means, for example, I have a website like Booking.com. Booking.com will charge you a monthly membership fee of $50. If you pay the membership fee, you can display all your packages through Booking.com.\n[36:00] Muhammad: Meaning, compared to, say, a model where the website shows package pricing and takes 1% or 2% of the profit. Here, they wouldn't cut any 1% or 2% from you. The entire profit would be yours. The entire payment would be yours. You would handle everything. You would just advertise your profiles through this portal. But since they are generating traffic here, for that, you would have to pay a monthly membership fee. Would you be interested in something like this, or in this case?\n[36:31] Wayes Kuruni Azad: It would be, but perhaps not right now. But in the future...\n[36:37] Muhammad: But for your small business right now, then a \"pay-as-you-go\" model is more viable.\n[36:42] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Hmm.\n[36:42] Muhammad: Now, let's talk about your internal operations. Your international Hajj management, and then agency operations. If someone offers you a SaaS software to handle these, which helps you manage your customer CRM – as you said your customers are recurring and give referrals – to track these, track customer phone numbers, track interactions with customers, analyze these notes, would you be interested in using such software that ensures your data privacy, meaning your data remains with you and won't be leaked in any other way, a secure software? Or are you comfortable managing with Excel for now?\n[37:25] Wayes Kuruni Azad: We are doing it with Excel now. Because, you see, it all depends on a cost-benefit analysis. For example, the cost-benefit analysis is like this: suppose I'm doing a huge business. But now, for manpower, say, one person is not enough, two are needed. Then I would have to go for such software. But now, my volume is low. I can manage with Excel. And if you say to go for software now, for me, it's still expensive in terms of cost-benefit analysis. So, it seems that for now, it's not feasible for me to go for it. So, it all really depends on time. If your business is doing well, because what happens is, if you increase your expenditures a lot without generating revenue, then your future will be difficult. So, what will happen is, yes, okay, my business is growing. I've grown the business. I won't increase expenses in operations now. Then again, it will be wisest to depend on software. So, it might happen with time that now might not be the right time for me. And the right time might take one to one and a half years. So, the situation will actually demand what happens.\n[39:07] Muhammad: Brother, for example, if Excel is free for you, and the software is also free for you, but it just has an interface like Excel. The condition would be like this: when your volume increases above a certain level, then, say, user per month or 500 users per month, when it goes above that, then you'll have to pay, but below that number of users, it's less. But in that case, your challenge cost will be the switching cost, that you used Excel, and now moving to a new system, migrating, you don't have a cost for that. But this is an advanced system, and you'll have a learning curve here. Would you be comfortable with this, or is your switching cost still very high at this stage?\n[39:35] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, no, switching cost is not high for me right now. I will go for it if I find such an option.\n[39:41] Muhammad: Okay. Now let's talk about mobile apps, brother. You might have seen that pilgrims need guidance repeatedly, like messages on WhatsApp, continuous voice messages. Now, if there was an app that provides ritual guidance to pilgrims, like how to perform Tawaf, how to perform Sa'i for Umrah, and then your services, like which service provider to go to, directions from the agency, hotel name, and all documents like passport, visa, all available to the pilgrim through the app. Do you think pilgrims would be interested in using such apps?\n[40:27] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Yes, at some point, they will be. Because people will gradually move towards technology. So, what happens is that people are still not that much into it. Here, I would say that we need to be proactive. I mean, what does the customer want? We need to figure that out. For example, if an app is troublesome for them now, or they don't want to get into it, but if we can create something so handy, something that, what do you call it, in most cases, we see that people tend to avoid technology. But if you can make them understand that this is very convenient for you, and it will make your life easier, then people will use it. So, the responsibility to popularize it must be taken by us, the agencies who have built the apps. For example, for this, you need to do marketing, campaigns. How should these be done?\n[41:33] Wayes Kuruni Azad: For example, those who use Grameenphone or GP apps, MyGP. What did we all do before? We used to flexi-load money, send it via bKash. But we didn't want to enter the MyGP app. But what did Grameenphone do? They continuously campaigned about it: \"This comes in the MyGP app, MyGP is here, if you use MyGP, you'll get a bonus, if you do this with MyGP, you'll get this bonus, that bonus.\" What does it mean? They actually made us dependent on the app, yes. So, at one point, now it's seen that those who use the MyGP app are no longer interested in manual tasks. Now, it's seen that I didn't use to enter the MyGP app that much before. But now, I regularly visit the MyGP app and take services from there. But they persuaded me to use it. It's not that I found it easy; they encouraged me in various ways, motivated me, gave gifts, and repeatedly told me that I would find everything together there, adding this and that, and that's how they made me used to it. What will happen is that this is a ritual, our religious one, yes. So, being a religious ritual, what happens is that Hajj is performed once in a lifetime, as you said, Umrah and Hajj are done once in a lifetime. So, making them used to it is also difficult. And also, why would they, for example, if you want to go for Hajj in 2026 this year, and now you are told to download the app. Or you want to go for Umrah next week. Let's say Umrah is easier. You want to go for Umrah next week. Now, I told you, brother, download the app. In some cases, you will see that people are so busy that they will think, \"Why should I download an app that takes up space for a one-time thing?\" It will cross people's minds that after Umrah, this app will have no use. Yes. So, people will think, \"After Umrah, this app has no use.\" So, what will I do with it the second time? Should I delete it again?\n[43:40] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Many people won't want to install it. And if you give it to them, by the time they learn to use it, their time might have passed. Because by the time they become handy with this app, their time might have passed. So, an app will not be very easy if it's not accompanied by video tutorials or similar things; people aren't interested in just reading.\n[44:12] Muhammad: Oh, okay, brother, let me share something here. What if there's a learning program within the app? All the training you provide, all the tasks you teach, are integrated into the app. There's an integrated training module, and you can see how much training each pilgrim has completed, their mental preparedness, their logistical preparedness; you get an idea about these. And on top of that, the summary of that training, during Hajj and Umrah, they can see some short notes on their app screen, which they can use to perform their tasks. And along with that, all their logistical details—their guide's name, their hotel's name, their itinerary, all the tasks to perform—everything is available through the app. Do you think such an app would create value, Inshallah, right? And in this case, if your agencies need to push it, do you think it would make your work much easier? Initially, you might even have to do things like offering a 1000 Taka discount for using the app. To popularize the app among people initially, at some point, someone will give a profile saying, \"Brother, download this app, it's so good,\" yeah, like that. I feel that initially, it might be necessary to run campaigns like \"1000 Taka discount if you use the app,\" \"if you use the app,\" meaning such types. So, in that case, what if the same customer promises to buy your package through the app and uses the app, uses the app's training modules, and this makes your logistical things a bit easier? You don't have to continuously monitor them. They can self-guide their Umrah. Would you be willing to give a 1000 Taka discount to these customers if they use the app from your side? Since you already keep a very small profit margin. On top of that, would you be willing to give a 1000 Taka discount to those who use the app?\n[45:57] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, this is actually a win-win situation if it impacts my business, builds branding, and creates long-term value. If you can show this in any way. Actually, I mean, the agency needs to be shown that using this will impact your future business, increase your branding, and these things. Then it will happen. If you cannot show the agency this future benefit, then it's a bit difficult why I would spend this 1000 Taka.\n[46:31] Muhammad: I understand. In that case, your [best guess: push] is very important, right? But what if the app is not directly under your branding, but a separate branding like Booking.com or Trip.com, but the app gives you a very discounted thing? For example, the app's subscription cost for a trip might be 1000 Taka, but they tell you, \"We'll give it to your pilgrims for 200 Taka.\" Okay? Would you then be interested in promoting that? That could also be a win-win scenario, right?\n[46:58] Muhammad: Brother, that was our question. I'll just ask you two last questions and then finish. My first question is, if you look at your entire Umrah operation, logistics, and everything, if I ask you about the top five challenges that are really big challenges for you right now, what would those five challenges be? First. And second, what are the top five challenges pilgrims face based on the complaints you hear from them? If you can share five from your side and five from the pilgrims' side. If you think you have five challenges, fine, you can mention three.\n[47:50] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Yes. If I talk about the main challenges of the business now, the main challenge is that most agencies are still person-dependent, and customers also want person-dependent service. For example, my pilgrims went with Shepherd this time, but they wished I was there; they would have been happy if I was. Now, for Umrah too, if I stay in Saudi Arabia all year, who will look after my sales from here? Who will handle marketing? Or my entire overall operation? Right. So, the big challenge in this business is personal involvement. Meaning, your going to Saudi Arabia or practicing regularly. For example, if I know that if I regularly take a group once a month, my business can be doubled or tripled, yes. But then again, in the long run, it will hold you back. Because if you always stay outside the business like this, without a proper setup yet, I cannot run the business through anyone else right now. No one can go there on my behalf. So, the number one challenge is that person-dependency is very high here. That's one. Number two is the price. In terms of price, it's seen that hotel prices and airline prices are causing a lot of trouble now. I would say this is temporary, but due to the high airline prices, we have to increase our package prices. Because we don't get normal airline prices now. Now, it's seen that if you try to buy an airline ticket, even a month or a month and a half later, it comes to around 95, 93, or 1 lakh Taka. But we have to buy tickets between 90 thousand and 1 lakh Taka. That's actually [inaudible] a challenge to give that price to the customer because...\n[50:06] Muhammad: Where do you get your airline prices from? Do you use GDS like Sabre or Galileo, or do you buy directly from the airlines?\n[50:11] Wayes Kuruni Azad: No, not directly. We have sub-agents of this kind, regular parallel sub-agents. We get it from them. So, there's an issue with these airline tickets. And speaking of other challenges, a big challenge is that hotel restrictions are increasing in Makkah and Madinah. For example, hotels are being demolished, and some are being shut down due to non-compliance. Because of this, hotel prices are increasing every year. We usually expected that after Ramadan, after Hajj, we would be able to offer hotels at good rates, good packages. But actually, we can't now. We have to increase the prices now because some hotels are closing down. And new Saudi regulations are being introduced, like hotel confirmation and ticket booking through apps. These things, meaning maintaining these normal compliances, are increasing business costs. When business costs increase, whether it's operational costs or our logistics costs, package prices also increase. You could say that this is a major challenge. I believe these two are the main challenges. From the customer's point of view, most complaints are that most agencies don't keep their promises. Expectations are very high when they go. And the big problem is, this is a problem from both sides – our challenge as agency owners and the customers' challenge. The hotel service in Saudi Arabia does not match international service. It doesn't even match the service in Cox's Bazar or any hotel in Dhaka. Their service level is actually very... it's seen that those who go for Hajj or Umrah for the first time are quite surprised by the hotel service. Even in a 3-star or non-star hotel, the way they receive or interact with pilgrims... and people go to Makkah and Madinah, a sacred place, with very high expectations, thinking that everyone there is very religious, everyone will sacrifice, adjust, and there will be no price [inaudible], no increase in prices due to demand and supply. People get surprised when they don't get proper hotel service or don't get what they expect. For example, the behavior in the lifts, these are normal manners that one expects there. Not getting those manners often leaves pilgrims dissatisfied, and later, after 10 complaints, it goes back to the agency, \"Which hotel did you give us?\" Actually, we know that the standard of Saudi hotels is like this, Saudi people are like this, Saudi people treat Bengalis like this.\n[53:14] Muhammad: Do you think the racism factor also plays a role here? Racism factor also plays a role somewhat, right?\n[53:19] Wayes Kuruni Azad: Which one?\n[53:19] Muhammad: The racism factor also plays a role in that case. I understand. Okay, brother. So, it means you don't face much challenge from the logistical side or the agent service side. The main challenges are some Saudi Ministry compliances, airline tickets, and pilgrims' expectations, more like hotel plus cultural adjustment. These are mainly the challenges. Brother Azad, these were mainly the things for today. Thank you very much for giving us so much time. Inshallah, I will follow up with you later about the potential solutions we can bring and how we can make them useful for you. Perhaps we will brief that later. Thank you."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: The meeting is being recorded. Assalamualaikum Brother, you can hear me, right?\nMuhammad: Yes, I can hear you. You are listening. First, a little context. Alhamdulillah (Praise be to Allah), this meeting is part of a venture studio program in Malaysia named Hasan VC. So, I have successfully completed their seven-day boot camp, alhamdulillah, and from there they decided to help me further if I have any business ideas to work on. So, since Hajj and Umrah are my core passion and interest, and I work with software, I want to explore how software and AI can be used in Hajj and Umrah. For this purpose, they gave me a thesis format for market research and to understand the ecosystem, and to explore what challenges are involved for each stakeholder that we can solve with technology. So, we are interviewing various people involved in the market. Various stakeholders, including pilgrims and Hajj Umrah agencies in Bangladesh. Then we are also interviewing the small sales representatives, Insha'Allah (God willing). So, as part of that, we are talking to you today, Insha'Allah. So, Brother, for convenience, I will record our meeting, Insha'Allah, there's no problem with that, right?\nAbdullah Saleh: No, no problem.\nAbdullah Saleh: Okay, Brother, then I will start this. However, you should not directly use this as a clip anywhere; only take information from it.\nMuhammad: Okay, Insha'Allah, I will only share it with the mentors in Malaysia. They might review it for analysis for this business purpose, but outside of that, Insha'Allah, I will not share it anywhere.\nMuhammad: Okay, so let's start, Brother. Alhamdulillah, Shepherd Agency is one of Bangladesh's most reputable agencies working now. So, for your current customer base, where do your main customer leads actually come from? How do you collect your customers?\nAbdullah Saleh: The main answer is through referrals. Our maximum pilgrims come through referrals from previous pilgrims. This is one aspect. Secondly, we have some brothers and relatives who were our former pilgrims. They also work with us. So, leads come from that source. And thirdly, we have online campaigns on Facebook. That, and our former pilgrims' WhatsApp groups, we get leads from there. There are other small sources, but these are the main ones.\nMuhammad: Okay, so with your current level of capacity and the level of assistance you deal with for Hajj and Umrah every year, are you happy with this, or do you want to scale your business further?\nAbdullah Saleh: No, from a business perspective, if we can take around 100 [pilgrims], an office can sustain itself, or salaries can be paid. If we can take 100 or 150 pilgrims, they are relatively sustainable. 150 is a good number for sustainability. 100 can run minimally sustainably, and if it's 150, then so we usually stay above 150. So, in that regard, alhamdulillah, we are doing well. And regarding the numbers, it's a continuous development. This is, I mean, continuous development. So, there is market demand, and customers probably keep coming. So, you see, slowly the growth is happening, or it happens to everyone. But we don't have any particular [target], or it's not like we have to reach 5000. Because we try to bring as good a service as possible. Maybe with more teachers, it could be done. But if it's like that, then for example, we are expanding our management as well to provide service now. So, if we think about continuous development or growth, the number of pilgrims is increasing, but for us, around 100 something plus-minus is our limit. If it's too much, it's [inaudible].\nMuhammad: So, Brother, if I summarise, the conversation got a bit off-topic, but what I understand, to summarise, your current capacity is a minimum of 150. But if you take a bit more than that, it's more than sustainable for you, and you're not thinking about exclusive growth. Your main focus is to ensure service level and sustainable growth.\nAbdullah Saleh: Exactly.\nMuhammad: Okay, I understand. So, Brother, that number of 150 pilgrims, does it come easily every year from your revenue channels? And in this regard, what are the main challenges you face? Especially since you mentioned you work with many sub-agent brothers. What obstacles do you face in managing them, and what solutions do you use in that regard?\nAbdullah Saleh: Definitely, if someone wants to work with us, their objective is to gain good deeds through serving pilgrims.\nMuhammad: It sounds a bit off-topic, it seems you are speaking from far away, could you please pay attention to the audio?\nAbdullah Saleh: Can you hear me now?\nMuhammad: Yes, now it's very clear, alhamdulillah.\nAbdullah Saleh: Yes.\nAbdullah Saleh: Okay, no, what I was saying is, those who work cooperatively with us, their main focus is pilgrim service. Professionally, purely from a business perspective, I think we have only one such company, Brother Company. And for the rest, everyone's objective, or rather, good intention, is to try and please Allah by serving the pilgrims. So, this is one side. The other side is that in practice, it's seen that the way we understand what's good and bad by serving pilgrims year after year, and try to take care of it from our office, it's perhaps not always possible for them because they still have a lot more to learn. So, at times, the briefing given to the pilgrim about Hajj or our service might not be a complete picture. So, then it's seen that for the pilgrims we handle directly, and what they do in the beginning, eventually everyone joins together. But what they do in the initial stages might have some information gaps. Information gaps. Or gaps in understanding in some areas. So, later we have to give them extra time and try to explain. So, for some, the gap remains until the end, for others, it recovers from it. So, this gap is basically the main problem. Other than that, I don't think we faced any particular problems. And we maintain a personal level of communication with them, beyond just business or professional deals. We try to minimise any gaps among ourselves through spending time together, meetings, training, meals, etc. In that sense, we believe that those who work with us appreciate our efforts and our communication compared to working with any other company, and they also communicate back with us in the same way.\nMuhammad: I understand. So, what happens here is you try to maintain a personal relationship with them beyond professional dealings, and in that case, the only problem you've faced so far is that there might be some communication gaps with your source pilgrims, but you fill those in later. Okay, so in that case, what happens is many sales agents, especially those who work professionally, often work with multiple agencies. So, how do you ensure that you receive the proper majority of leads, given that they might also be working with your rival agencies? And in that regard, there's also the issue of business secrets. Those who are working with you might learn many of your business secrets. They might learn about your technology. How do you ensure that this is not passed on to your rival companies?\nAbdullah Saleh: Yes, business... what was the question again?\nMuhammad: I mean, suppose those who are working as sub-agents with you, they can also work as sub-agents with other agencies, with other companies, right?\nAbdullah Saleh: Yes, with other companies, to our knowledge, those who work with us do not go to other companies. There's a commitment at that level, I believe. Still, if someone does go without informing us, that's beyond our control and purview, and perhaps it's better not to look in that direction too much. Because we have an understanding with them that they might be working only with us and not with anyone else. So that's why I said, if someone else does something on the other side, it's beyond our knowledge. But we try to develop such a relationship or want to, that whatever service is needed, they take it from us. And as for other agencies and parties they work with, that's entirely a professional deal. That means there's no personal intimacy or relationship there, or like our pilgrims who worked with us, where pilgrim service plays a very important role, the interest there, that kind of deal is less about that and more about business-related money matters, who offered how much, less or more. Due to these price differences, partners change. But we have seen that those who are working with us have been working with us for a long time, for repeated years. So, we have an idea that those who work with us, work only with us and no one else. This is it.\nMuhammad: Okay, so in that case, Brother, if I talk about a system instead of a human. Suppose a software system works as a sales channel for you, and other agencies can also display their packages and all their details there. Would you be interested in working with such a system? But then, what about a B2C platform, like booking.com or Agoda for travel, which sells hotel offers? In the case of Hajj, if a B2C platform sells your packages, would you be interested in working with them?\nAbdullah Saleh: If B2C means creating packages based on customer demand, then we would not be interested. Because as days are passing, it's becoming necessary to work on a larger scale. That is, now no single license can work alone. Many licenses and many pilgrims have to work together. That's why we ourselves are trying to reduce the number or variation of our packages while keeping customers intact. Because it's becoming difficult for us to purchase and design countless pilgrims and countless packages with a single license. In that case, where we want to reduce our purchases or other issues in Saudi Arabia, if individual pilgrims contact us, they will definitely inquire about their requirements. That's one problem. And the second problem is, not to mention that they have so many types of packages, but also to see that if individual packages are created, the prices of the packages will increase. Because when we buy in bulk, we get a good rate. But when we buy based on individual requests, the rate will increase. If the rate increases, then the person who created the package will say, \"The price has increased so much.\" So, these problems exist. Now, if in the future the market shifts that way, where everyone is purchasing online in different ways and services can be provided, then we might try. In the current context, it seems impossible.\nMuhammad: In this current context, what you are saying is a challenge, that if multiple Hajj pilgrims or multiple people come to you, then catering to each of them will not be scalable for you. And that will be challenging for you. But if someone sells your existing packages as is on their online portal, and if there is a good response in the market, then you will have no problem. Right?\nAbdullah Saleh: If someone does that, and sells your existing Hajj and Umrah packages as is through an online platform, then Insha'Allah, you will have no objection. But if each one, it actually depends on what kind of packaging, offering, and dealing it is. Because here, taking a pilgrim to a country involves a long time staying and eating with them. So, there is a comfort aspect for the pilgrim. A pilgrim has some things to say. They have some issues. If the deal can be closed considering all these things, because pilgrim service is important, and their welfare is important, their comfort is important. So, if these are maintained properly and selling in this way does not create any problem, if there are no gaps or mistakes, then it can be done. But it has to be done case by case, by knowing and understanding. It cannot be said yes or no in one go.\nMuhammad: I understand, Brother. Let me share something else with you. You mentioned that in terms of marketing, if a big volume comes, then catering to each of them is a problem. But now we are seeing that in many cases, AI is taking over the tasks of marketing communication. Now, if an AI model learns from your existing packages and practices, specifically trained on your data and specialties, plus the overall Hajj agency market, and if such a trained AI model exists and it handles your initial customer interaction, then it can handle a very large volume. Would you be interested in trying out this kind of system?\nAbdullah Saleh: As I said, it's difficult to say without understanding these things. We need to look at each thing case by case, understand its pros and cons, problems, issues, and challenges, and then we can say.\nMuhammad: Okay, so you want to evaluate these things now? Meaning, neither totally no nor yes, but you will decide after evaluating?\nAbdullah Saleh: I understand.\nMuhammad: Okay, that's done. Now, let's move on to your sourcing. Brother, in Hajj and Umrah agencies, a major problem is sourcing hotels from Makkah and Madinah. And in Makkah and Madinah, as we have researched, the Saudi government has very strict rules and regulations, and hotels are sold in a pyramid layer system. So, in this case, what challenges do you face in sourcing truly credible services, and how do you ensure that the services you are purchasing are credible and will serve your customers 100% without any surprises?\nAbdullah Saleh: Up until now, the system we are using, you could call it a trial. We have been in this line for about 10 or 11 years. And in the beginning, what we used to say, there might be changes in our words now. That is, what we can do, what is within our reach, we tell them that we will be able to do this, Insha'Allah. And for things that have some uncertainty, we tell them that these are not sure, uncertain, they may or may not get it. And for things that are very rarely possible, we tell them that it's better not to ask for them because the possibility is low. So, we've been doing it that way, and it has constantly changed. So, every year when new rules come, we assess it again and try to understand what is possible and what is not. According to that, the final work and final payments are made. Bookings have to be made in advance. Processing is done by giving advance passport copies. But the actual final package itinerary takes some time to prepare. Because many things are not yet ready information for us. So, after those come, then we actually do the final tuning by seeing what is possible and inform everyone what is coming and what is not.\nMuhammad: What you do is, even before starting the package, you buy the services like hotels and transportation on demand, according to your estimation. After purchasing, you share this with your customers. And you only promise about things that are within your control, and for things where you don't have 100% control, you don't promise them strongly to the customers. So, Brother, in this regard, what would you say are the most challenging things you face when purchasing these services, whether it's hotels, transportation, or food? For which things do you find the promise to be solid, and for which do you face extreme challenges? And what other ancillary challenges do you face in this regard?\nAbdullah Saleh: No, actually, for some things, I mean, most of the purchases are now done on the Saudi platform; they are available on the platform, and hotels must be bought from there. So, if I don't buy the hotel, I won't be able to get the visa. That's why we are providing the hotel, along with the food and transportation, this is certain. Without this, there will be no Hajj package; it's designed that way. So, we are providing this, it's certain. But what we don't make certain is which specific hotel we are buying. I mentioned quality and distance. There might be three, four, or five hotels of the same quality, in the same range, and generally at the same distance or within a certain distance. So, then we state the range, the distance, the quality of the hotel, the quality of the food, and how the transportation will be. But we definitely do not specify that \"this exact hotel will be provided,\" or \"the food will be exactly like this,\" or \"transportation will be provided by such and such company.\" We don't say that because these can be different. The commitment to the pilgrims is that what is promised will be delivered. Whether it's [best guess: wise] or quality-wise, [best guess: etc. as], it's delivered in that way. And when bookings are confirmed, then we inform them of the hotel name. So, there hasn't been any problem so far. No one has objected to the quality we promised versus how we later made the purchases, or there haven't been majority objections even after staying. There are a couple of small cases that need to be dealt with, and they get resolved. There's an issue, they have to deal with it. Other than that, no. But, I mean, specifically naming a hotel or a specific meal, we don't want to do that, nor should we, because these can be different, they do become different.\nMuhammad: Okay, so that means it's understood that the hotels you buy are more or less guaranteed. Meaning, it's never happened that you bought a hotel and later found out you didn't get it, or the hotel was sold out, or your customers faced problems after you bought them a hotel. Is the same true for transportation? For example, when a bus or car is supposed to arrive, do the drivers maintain 100% commitment, and do you also purchase this through the verified Nusuk platform?\nAbdullah Saleh: Yes, that's it. How do I say this? Yes, the hotels we buy are generally within our specific framework, and we always have communication with them. So, by the grace of Allah, we haven't encountered any major problems or issues in any of our purchases so far. The Hajj packages have various designs. These designs are made by the Saudis and various Saudi companies. Transportation designs are also in place. Who goes where, who comes where—the Saudi government designs this. So, actually, whoever wants to manage their program can plan and purchase things accordingly. That's generally the main point. But no one makes definite promises at the beginning, nor should they. Giving specific names and finalising everything beforehand and selling packages with fear—that can't be done. If you try to do that, there will be risks. Because the hotel I prefer might have been fully booked in advance by someone else, meaning I won't get a single seat. But I might be able to take the building next to it, which is available. Not everything gets sold out at the same time. So, that's how it is. Did I make it clear, or should I explain more?\nMuhammad: I understand for the most part. So, in that case, you have to physically go and purchase things. You can't do it online, right?\nAbdullah Saleh: Actually, the system is mostly online, on an online platform, and anyone can buy a hotel from Bangladesh if they want. But it's often seen that you have to go to the city area, see the hotel, understand how the hotel staff will provide service, whether what's seen in pictures is practical or different, to understand these things, you have to go. Sometimes you have to talk directly with hotel owners because they receive many requests. For example, for the number of seats a hotel has, they might receive double the requests they can take. Now, which one will they approve, which one will they say yes to, and which one no? So, they have an expectation that they should be spoken to verbally, and that their requirement for so many pilgrim seats, and their online request, should be accepted. For these matters, they often have expectations. On the other hand, there are many hotels that accept requests simply submitted online. So, there is a difference among these. And we have seen that other Hajj agencies have gone to buy hotels in person from before. So, we are still following that system. In the future, if it becomes more modern and there's no need to go, if it can be bought online, then perhaps many won't go either. Maybe they'll just finish their purchases sitting at home online.\nMuhammad: I understand. So, there's a common complaint here. NRC owners sometimes have it, and pilgrims sometimes have it. It's seen that they might promise a three-star, but it's not actually a three-star hotel. Or they might promise certain things will be there, but they're not in the hotel. Is it to mitigate these issues that you go there in person?\nAbdullah Saleh: Yes, these problems will always exist. These always exist. Now, with everything combined, yes, we try to ensure that there are no issues. After purchasing, if we find any hiccup or problem somewhere. To avoid that, I try to go physically, inspect in person, and if possible, talk to the main hotel owners before proceeding. Yes.\nMuhammad: Let me share another thing with you here. Do you follow this same process for Umrah as well, purchasing entirely through the Nusuk platform and going in person, or is the Umrah purchasing process a bit different?\nAbdullah Saleh: No, Umrah was easy until 2024. Any hotel could be bought, any transport could be arranged, any airline ticket could be used, etc. But from this year, new rules have come for Umrah: Umrah hotels must be bought from Nusuk, and Umrah transport must also be notified to Nusuk. They want every pilgrim, after entering Saudi Arabia, to have a specific hotel and a specific transport arrangement so that they don't get stuck at the airport, not knowing where to go or what to do, feeling confused. That used to happen before. So, they want this. They want it to be more systematic, which is why they want hotels to be bought from Nusuk, good quality hotels, and for transportation to be provided through a company. And these must be updated in Nusuk, or are already being updated this year, and they are taking action against those who are not complying. So, for Umrah too, things are moving towards this systematic approach from 2025. This will ultimately improve pilgrim service, but the more systems are applied, the fewer loopholes there are, so people are forced to buy proper, expensive things, and prices increase. This is what happened with Hajj before, and it's happening with Umrah now; prices are increasing.\nMuhammad: Okay, so here's something I want to ask. Previously, people would sell a hotel through multiple layers. Now, after the platform came, that's not exactly how it works. Now, Nusuk buys directly from the hotel and sells it to you. So, in between, Nusuk is the intermediary; no one else. Is that how it is, or is the pyramid layer marketing still there?\nAbdullah Saleh: No, up until now, the system is becoming Nusuk-dependent. Whoever does the work, they have to process all Hajj and Umrah through Nusuk. Yes. Visas have already been online for many years. Hajj visas, Umrah visas, all are on online platforms. And services, starting from hotel purchases, are slowly coming online. So, there is no other special service arrangement outside of this, nor will there be. This is how it will continue.\nMuhammad: Now, when you buy hotels from Nusuk, how do you buy them? Do you buy them on demand, or are they prepaid and then sold to you? And in that case, what challenges do you face?\nAbdullah Saleh: For Hajj, we have to transfer money to the Saudi Nusuk platform. They create an account for us, license-wise, after receiving the money. So, that money, converted from Bangladeshi Taka to Saudi Riyal, is deposited in our new system account. When we buy, we send a request online. If the hotel owner accepts the request, then the money is transferred from our account to their account. That's how the system works. For Umrah, the payment system has not been inaugurated yet. That is, our money will go to Saudi Arabia via Nusuk, and from there, we will pay directly online. This has not started for Umrah yet. For now, we have to deliver the money to the hotel owner through other channels, whether cash or some other way. And for the hotel, we have to buy it online and create a document, which the pilgrim has to show when they travel.\nMuhammad: Okay, for the Umrah packages you are currently offering, if a pilgrim goes for 10 or 15 days, you purchase the hotel for the full 10 or 15 days from the new platform for them, and in that case, the BRN (Booking Reference Number) is used for their final work. Is that how it is? And another very common complaint heard from pilgrims regarding transportation is that drivers do not keep their commitments, they scam a lot of money for short distances, and there's a lot of price disparity. So, in this case, for those who take service from you, and when you deal with drivers, how do you handle managing the local taxis or local transportation, which is not directly Hajj or Umrah transport, but rather for sightseeing or moving around? How do you ensure this for both Hajj and now Umrah?\nAbdullah Saleh: For Hajj and now for Umrah, in both cases, it has to be taken through a company. So, ultimately, the quality of service increases there. Now, since their company cars are more expensive than street cars, they will naturally provide better service. Cars are ready beforehand. After the passengers arrive, the car might be waiting at the airport, and there's a connection with the driver through conversation or whatever means. For Hajj, the government officials themselves manage the car boarding, checking the pilgrim's number from where cars are parked, and setting which car they will board. They put them in the car under their supervision. Our agency has no role here. For Hajj, the Saudi government itself is handling the car boarding. And that car has documents, so the driver knows where to drop them, which hotel. For Umrah, it has just started, so this year the system is not fully ready yet. However, we are sending them in company cars, and we are detailing to the driver which hotel the pilgrim needs to be dropped off at. So, there's no problem. Pilgrims are reaching their hotels properly. When someone takes a random car or hasn't even taken a car, what used to happen at the airport before was that they would arrive at the airport and then not know how to reach the hotel. They would wander around, many would get lost. All these things are to\nAbdullah Saleh: be controlled by the new, professional system that the Saudis have mandated as law for us. So, if it's done that way, the pilgrim has no tension. They will reach their destination properly. If that doesn't happen, then for a couple of years in between, the Saudi government had this system: if someone arrived and couldn't say whether their car had come or what their driver's number was, then government officials would put them in a car. And that bill would be charged to the Umrah visa company, saying, \"Your passenger arrived without any car, so we put them in a car, and the car bill is this much.\" So, after these bills came, the respective Bangladeshi agent for Umrah, whoever they were working with, would demand payment from them, saying, \"They didn't have any car, they billed me, so you will bill me.\" That's how it was. And from this year, Nusuk has become mandatory for Umrah as well. So, this is the situation. But if someone foolishly tries to take a car themselves or do something, even if someone buys a hotel now, they won't be able to get a visa. Because if they don't buy the hotel from Nusuk and instead buy it through, say, booking.com, and they don't know the system for approving it through the hotel, then when they take that hotel and go to an agency for a visa, the agency will say, \"Nusuk-approved hotel.\" If they can't provide a Nusuk-approved hotel, then they are in trouble again. So, this is generally the situation: a Bangladeshi pilgrim actually cannot do anything on their own now. If they try, they will face problems and will have to come to some Umrah agency. Hajj itself is impossible without Hajj business; no Hajj processing can be done by a pilgrim alone. So, ultimately, the bottom line here is that everything will now be through Nusuk, and pilgrims will get good service through Nusuk. However, it should be checked whether the agency is following the rules and is reputable. Otherwise, some dishonest companies might still try to bypass the system and send them. Ultimately, they will also be losers because later there will be penalties on them, and their Hajj will be at risk without proper guidance. This is the situation.\nMuhammad: I understand. And in terms of your business, you don't have to deal with anyone other than Nusuk now; you can directly purchase packages from Nusuk, right?\nAbdullah Saleh: For Umrah, it's not like that. We select a hotel. If we like it, then we check its name on the Nusuk online platform. Yes, yes, the approval process, everything will be found on Nusuk. When it's found on Nusuk, then we say, \"My [pilgrim] is going on the 11th, please create the document for me,\" and then they give it to me.\nMuhammad: Brother, your voice is unclear again. Could you please repeat that once?\nAbdullah Saleh: What I am saying is, now to buy a hotel, you have to buy it from Nusuk. And for the hotel I like in Nusuk, it needs to be ensured whether they have given approval. If approved, after getting the Nusuk approval, those numbers must be entered into the visa platform when applying for the visa. Only then is the visa issued. I mean, basically, a visa application must be made with a Nusuk-approved hotel, specifying when they will enter Makkah, when they will leave, all details about the hotel, etc. Previously, nothing was required for a visa. Now, along with that, transport information must be provided: when they will be picked up and taken to the hotel. At least [best guess: one] information must be there, meaning from Madinah to Madinah hotel, from Madinah airport, or from Jeddah airport to Makkah hotel, this one transport is mandatory. Visas can be issued even without that in between. So, this is the matter.\nMuhammad: Okay, so that means you buy Nusuk-approved hotels and then enter them into the system. So, what is the actual system for buying the hotel? Do you buy the hotel directly from the hotel owners or from those agents there, as usual now, but then enter it into Nusuk later? Is that mainly the summary now, right?\nAbdullah Saleh: Now, to buy a hotel, we somehow have to reach the main owner of the hotel or the person who has access to Nusuk's software. That can be through an agent. We can also do it directly. Or if possible, we can do it by phone. But ultimately, the person who will give the approval by sitting at the software, who has that access, whether it's the main owner or the company or group that has bought the responsibility of the hotel for one year or five years, someone like that will have the access. We have to find that person and get it from them. That's how it is.\nMuhammad: Okay, we'll end our interview now. Just a few rapid questions. The challenge now is customer satisfaction. How do you ensure your customers are satisfied with your service and that they are providing you with proper referrals, so you get 150+ pilgrims every year? How do you ensure this, and what is your challenge in that regard?\nAbdullah Saleh: For pilgrims, the main thing is what pilgrims actually want from a Hajj, and what they get. Yes, for both Hajj and Umrah, that's what you're saying.\nMuhammad: Yes, that's it. What they can want, what they should want, what they shouldn't want, what can be obtained, what cannot be obtained – communicating these things to them, we believe, is the most important thing, since it's not a free [service] for many."

The aim of this interview is to document female pilgrim-specific challenges, safety concerns, comfort, and spiritual experiences, and to identify solutions to improve the journey for women.\n[00:00] Muhammad: Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah. Today we are interviewing Zohora Khanam. You performed Hajj in 2024. So, to start, could you please tell us a little about your personal identity and share how you prepared for Hajj, what challenges you faced during your preparations, and how you overcame those challenges? Please share that with us.\n[00:23] Zohora Khanam: Thank you. Alhamdulillah, I performed Hajj in 2024. Before that, for a long time, I had this thought that I would, Insha'Allah, perform Hajj sometime in the future. So, with that thought, I was always wondering when I would perform Hajj, when that time would come. Since around 2015, the idea of performing Hajj had crossed my mind, that I would go for Hajj if the opportunity arose. So, I always kept that thought in mind. Then, a few members of my family performed Hajj. Through them, I also inquired about how Hajj could actually be performed. Some members of my family had performed Hajj with an agency, and their reputation was very good. Above all, by the grace of Allah, in 2024, my brother and my sister-in-law also decided that they would perform Hajj. I completed this Hajj with them.\n[01:21] Muhammad: Okay. So your family members had gone for Hajj with one agency before. And then this time, some of your other relatives went with a different agency. You had two agency choices for your Hajj, where your family members had previously performed Hajj. One was Shepherd, and the other was where your sisters-in-law had performed Hajj. Why did you choose Shepherd? Why not the other agency, or why was this your preference?\n[01:54] Zohora Khanam: My sisters-in-law also went. Their connection was such that they were Sonali Bank officials. So, they were acquainted with that agency through Sonali Bank. That's why they had faith in performing Hajj with them. I wasn't really that familiar with them. But with Shepherd, my sister and family members had gone before, and their overall performance was very satisfactory. They received the service exactly as it was committed. Because of this, I developed trust in them. Additionally, when we decided that we would, Insha'Allah, perform Hajj in '24, my brother, myself, and several other agencies communicated to gather information from them. After communicating with everyone, we also inquired about two or three other agencies. We looked into how they operate, what their journey would be like, what facilities they could provide, and another important factor was the budget – that it needed to be within everyone's affordability. So, after considering everything, we felt that Shepherd was the most suitable for us. And considering their previous commitments, it seemed like, \"Yes, we will go with Shepherd.\" That's why we finally chose Shepherd.\n[03:22] Muhammad: When you compared budgets, did Shepherd offer similar package prices to other agencies, or were the prices more or less?\n[03:31] Zohora Khanam: The prices weren't really similar; there was a slight plus-minus fluctuation. But what happened was, for instance, with Shepherd, it was proven. My family members who went the previous year, in '22, had a proven experience of where they stayed in Makkah, what the hotel conditions were like, where they stayed in Mina, what the conditions were like, and other facilities. It was all proven, and they assured us that they would provide these. Other agencies might have had a slight difference in budget, a little more or less in some cases. But we didn't have any proven experience with those agencies to go through them. We could have trusted their commitment and gone, perhaps. But one always thinks about what I actually received in my real experience and what I am going to receive. Considering this, Shepherd seemed appropriate. I understand. So, referrals were a big deal for you in this case. Now, if we move on, the first stage of your Hajj was mental, physical, and preparatory. Mental preparation involves two things: logistical preparation, which is knowing the rules and regulations of Hajj, what to do, what kind of things to face; and religious preparation, such as what religious rituals are involved, what needs to be done.\n[05:07] Muhammad: How did you take these preparations, and how did they assist you in this regard?\n[05:13] Zohora Khanam: In this regard, I would say that we don't really know how other agencies do it since we haven't been with them. But in Shepherd's case, I can say that they prepared us very thoroughly for all aspects – be it physical, mental, or religious. They oriented us for a long time. Even when we first registered for Hajj, we hadn't made a final decision about which agency to go with, or whether to go with Shepherd. It was just the initial registration. From then on, they primarily communicated with us for various orientations. They created a group for us and sent us various messages about when an orientation would be held. They held these on weekends, which made it easy for us, the service holders, to participate on Fridays or Saturdays. So, they comprehensively covered what kind of problems might arise during Hajj, what kind of mental preparation is needed, how to maintain physical fitness, and what kind of religious preparations and acts of worship are required. They did this in various stages, several times. And not just physically, they also shared these virtually, and they provided us with various books and documentation on the subject, which made it very convenient to access and study these opportunities. And then, regarding your preparation, were the classes you attended in-person or online?\n[06:50] Zohora Khanam: In most cases, I attended in-person because it was held on weekends, and we had the opportunity. And since we had a strong desire, every person who intends to perform Hajj wishes that it be completed smoothly and beautifully, wholeheartedly. That was certainly the case for us. For example, my brother and his wife might not have been able to attend physically for the entire duration, but they did attend in-person towards the end. And whenever there was a meeting, whether it was a Zoom meeting or anything else, they would send us a link so that those who were expatriates, living abroad, could participate.\n[07:44] Muhammad: Are you saying that both in-person and Zoom sessions are effective? I would say in-person is a bit better because when you go there, you have a sharing experience with other pilgrims who are preparing for Hajj. You get to know their opinions, there's an open discussion. Among them, you'd find many pilgrims who have performed Hajj before. You could also learn their opinions. They would share their experiences. That's why I felt in-person was better.\n[08:18] Muhammad: The benefit of in-person here is with previous pilgrims.\n[08:23] Zohora Khanam: Somewhat, yes.\n[08:24] Muhammad: Okay.\n[08:24] Muhammad: Alright, after that, when you went for Hajj, you had already taken spiritual and logistical preparations. Then, regarding the rituals of Hajj days, such as performing Tawaf, Sa'i, and then during the subsequent recitations, did you use any books for these, or did you remember them from your training?\n[08:52] Zohora Khanam: No, they always oriented us step by step, from the very beginning of Hajj, from the month of Dhul Hijjah when Hajj begins, which means from the start of our journey, from when we board the plane, every step of the way. They oriented us on how to prepare at Bangladesh airport, how to proceed after landing at Makkah airport, what kind of welcome we would receive, how our hotel stay would be, when to perform which acts of worship during Hajj. They shared all these step by step, through presentations, PowerPoint, and discussions. Additionally, they provided us with various books and Duas (supplications). They guided us on when to recite which Dua, what kind of worship to perform, how to perform Tawaf, and what Duas to recite when staying in the plain of Arafat. They provided us with every step in advance.\n[10:17] Muhammad: Which one did you use? Did you study beforehand and go for Umrah, or did you take some books with you during Umrah?\n[10:27] Zohora Khanam: I did some studying beforehand. I had also done some before, and at the same time, I had those books with me. I perhaps looked through the books a bit before I left. The book was always with me.\n[10:44] Muhammad: Okay, in that case, regarding the Dua books that need to be read during that time. When you were there, during Tawaf and Sa'i, were you reading from those books you took with you?\n[10:55] Zohora Khanam: Yes. Some were memorised. Those that weren't memorised, I would read from the book. But I always kept them with me.\n[11:06] Muhammad: Okay. Don't you think a good alternative to books in this case could be a mobile app? For instance, if the Duas were short-listed in the app in a very simple format, you could just look and read whichever Duas you need for Tawaf, or for Sa'i. Could this be a possibility?\n[11:28] Zohora Khanam: Yes, this is a very good opportunity. It would be excellent if this existed, because everyone uses mobile phones. When people go for Hajj, and when we went, everyone mandatorily had their mobile phone with them. In that case, if the Hajj details are available on the mobile, I think this could be a good initiative and would be very effective. Because if I take a book, I have to carry extra weight. If I take a bag or even a small purse, I have to carry some books or Dua books, whatever it is, some weight. But my mobile will always be with me. In that case, if I use my mobile, everything comes to my mobile. I think this would be good in one way.\n[12:35] Muhammad: Alright, Alhamdulillah, okay. Next, regarding mobile connectivity. You bought a mobile SIM in Saudi Arabia, right?\n[12:47] Zohora Khanam: Yes, a Saudi SIM there.\n[12:49] Muhammad: Okay, how long did it take you to buy the SIM?\n[12:51] Zohora Khanam: No, the SIM that the pilgrims received when we first arrived at the hotel. There, they instantly activated a SIM for one month. They provided the SIM for some Riyals, I think 500 Riyals, I don't remember correctly. With that amount of Riyals, they installed the SIM with a one-month validity immediately. We used it right away. It didn't take any time. It felt like it was done instantly. After the validity expired, we recharged it again.\n[13:41] Muhammad: Now, if it were like this, instead of buying a SIM there, you could directly buy a SIM from Grameenphone or Airtel in your home country before you leave, which would support you for two to three days, and could be extended if desired. And then you could take your time to buy a SIM there. Do you think this would be a good option for you, or do you think it's unnecessary?\n[14:14] Zohora Khanam: We already know that during our orientation, they mentioned that Robi's app has a mobile option for Hajj pilgrims, which can be taken. I don't know much about its usage, but if we could take it from our country, that would be good. I think it would be good. But I don't know how its usage would be. During the Hajj orientation, we were told that Robi or Grameen's card could be brought, and it would be part of the Hajj package, but we didn't get that opportunity, so I don't have a clear idea about it. However, if it's possible to take it from our country, I think that would be the best. In that case, language is an issue. Various messages come, or recharging, etc., and then I wouldn't have a language problem. If we take a SIM from Saudi Arabia, their messages come in Arabic, which we wouldn't understand when a message comes or how to operate it properly. If there was a problem, we would have to communicate with their mobile service centers.\n[15:37] Muhammad: Okay, you stayed for about a month. What did you do during that month?\n[15:43] Zohora Khanam: No, we stayed for more than a month. We went on an extended package, so it cost us for about 42 days. Before Hajj, we first went to Makkah Sharif. There, we performed Umrah. Then, every day, we would regularly perform Tawaf. We would perform Tawaf at the Kaaba. We would worship there as much as we could. For the rest of the time, we would pray in our rooms. Even if we didn't pray all five daily prayers, we tried to pray at least Asr, Maghrib, and Isha there. In most cases, we prayed Maghrib and Isha. On Fridays, we prayed Jummah there. Then we would sit and recite the Quran. We tried to perform Tawaf every day there. Besides this, after staying in Makkah Sharif, our agency also took us for some Ziyarahs (visits to historical and religious sites). They showed us various religious directives or historical places during these visits. And we also performed Umrah during these breaks. For example, we performed Umrah once after arriving from Bangladesh, and then we performed Umrah again after going to Taif. We had the opportunity to perform Umrah two or three times. After that, we went to Madinah Sharif. We stayed in Madinah for about eight or nine days. There, we prayed every prayer. We worshipped there. We also had the opportunity to perform some Ziyarahs, which we did. Then, returning from Madinah, we came back to Makkah, to the Kaaba in Makkah Sharif. We stayed there and participated in Hajj.\n[17:53] Muhammad: And now, exploring Ziyarah spots, nearby restaurants in Makkah and Madinah, shopping centers - how difficult was it for you to find these spots?\n[18:12] Zohora Khanam: If I were to say individually, it was absolutely impossible for us. Especially for us females, we didn't know any of the shops. And it wasn't easy to just go out whenever we wanted. Transportation was a big issue. There was no transport. And we didn't know the shops well. What little we did explore was with the agency's support. For example, the agency provided transport support for Ziyarahs, and we visited these places with their guides and guidance. So, when going outside the Haram compound, near the Haram, there were shops in Makkah and Madinah, and food spots. Do you think you easily found the main food shops and places for shopping, or do you think you could have found better places with more guidance?\n[19:28] Zohora Khanam: We actually had no idea. There are many shops, but we didn't know which shop was the best, where to find good quality items, or where to find specific items. We received no guidance on this. If someone had guided us or told us, \"This shop is good, you'll find good things here,\" or \"You'll find this here,\" we had no such concept. We were like blind people in the shops, wandering around and picking what we thought was best based on our own ideas. I understand. And regarding food, most of the time we ate through the agency; we didn't have much opportunity to eat outside, and we didn't have much idea about the food shops, as we had three meals a day provided by the agency.\n[20:30] Muhammad: Okay, now if it were like this, you have an app, and for the things you want to buy, there's a sort of Yellow Pages guide for nearby shops. For example, in your hotel, you might need kidney [presumably, an ingredient or specific type of food], or some dry food, or perhaps you need to buy a bag.\n[20:49] Muhammad: You could open the mobile app and see where you can find a bag or where you can find food nearby.\n[20:54] Muhammad: And in that case, say, in some cases, you could also see the quality or ratings. What are the prices like, how are the ratings from other people for that shop? If you could see these, and plus, say, some hidden shopping spots, like if you've been to Kakia Bazaar where everything is available wholesale, or the Madinah shopping spots. If you had recommendations for some markets within the app, do you think that would be beneficial?\n[21:28] Zohora Khanam: That would certainly be beneficial. If it's available through an app. If I can get all the information through my mobile, I can get it easily sitting in my room. I don't have to wander through many markets. And in Saudi Arabia, moving around during the day is difficult because of the intense heat. You usually go out only after evening. If there's an app that tells me where to buy what I need and that it's the best place, then I don't have to wander through eight or ten shops, which saves me physical effort. Transportation isn't always available, and there's a lot of walking involved. In that case, if I can find the shop in the app while in my room, confirm that I'll find the item there, and then go directly to that spot, it would save me financially, I wouldn't incur extra travel costs, or the cost of walking around to eight or ten shops. In terms of time, and if you consider cost, it would be beneficial in all aspects.\n[22:52] Muhammad: I understand. So you're saying that this would also be beneficial for you, of course.\n[22:57] Muhammad: Next, let's talk about your location. On your trip, you were with an elderly aunt, your brother, and your sister-in-law. In that situation, do you think sharing your location and seeing the location of your group members and your caravan in an app would be useful? Have you ever tried this?\n[23:25] Zohora Khanam: No, no, I didn't get the chance to do that. We saw that the Haram Sharif is such a vast place with so many people that if someone from the group got separated, it was very difficult to find them. That's why, in our group, since we were relatives – three or four, we were three females – we always moved together. Meaning, we communicated very closely all the time so that no one would get lost. And we had mobile phones; we communicated using our mobiles.\n[23:58] Muhammad: Okay. Yes, but—\n[24:00] Muhammad: Did anything like that ever happen? Did anyone in the group get lost?\n[24:02] Zohora Khanam: No, not completely lost. It was more like we couldn't find someone, and it took a long time to locate them, repeatedly communicating via mobile about this location and that location. But no one was ever completely lost.\n[24:26] Muhammad: Okay, when you went to the Haram, you often see that the police close gates and roads. Did you face any such problems?\n[24:34] Zohora Khanam: Yes, that happened constantly, and it was quite distressing. For example, we might be approaching a certain road, intending to enter through a specific gate, say gate number X. Upon arrival, we'd find the police had closed it. Moving from one gate to another requires a lot of walking. And during midday prayers, like Dhuhr or Asr, the sun is scorching. At that time, trying to find another open door or gate by wandering around was difficult. Since we weren't well-acquainted with Haram Sharif, which has many gates and doors, we didn't know which one would be easiest or which would lead directly to the Kaaba. This meant that often, for instance, yesterday we entered through one door, and the next day we targeted the same one, only to find it closed. Then we had to wander extensively to find another path, which took a lot of time. That was a problem. Then, sometimes we'd enter, perhaps to stand for prayer or preparing for prayer, and suddenly an escalator or something would stop. That was also a problem, having to find another way out. The exit paths were often problematic. This happened regularly, especially during Hajj when many, many people came, and on Fridays, it was common to suddenly find an area closed just as we were about to stand for prayer, forcing us to walk a lot to find another place to pray. These were constant issues. Okay, now, if there was a system, a crowdsourcing system, where you would be part of an online community, and everyone would help each other. For instance, you're going somewhere, and you see a gate closed. Then you would mark that spot on the map, indicating that a gate is closed there. And when someone else marks that a gate is closed or something similar, you would receive notifications. This would allow you to properly follow your trip. If such a system existed, which would be beneficial for everyone, would you actively participate in it, notifying others and receiving notifications from them?\n[27:26] Zohora Khanam: Yes, that would be very good. If, say, this communication happened within the group we traveled with, the agency or the specific group, I think that would be beneficial.\n[27:40] Muhammad: No, a group might have 100, 200, or 500 people. This would be a common community for everyone in Mecca, like Facebook. On Facebook, people share information, everyone shares, everyone sees it, and everyone benefits. It's kind of like that. For example, you see that a gate, say, Aziziya's gate, is closed, or the gate in front of Elaph Kin. You would then go there and write, there would be a button, \"Road Closure, Take Different Road.\" You yourself would mark the road. Then, others who come behind you would see that there's a road closure, police are not allowing passage. Or, say, it's prayer time, and the mosque is crowded. You could then provide an option like \"Mosque Courtyard Open.\" Then, if 10 people give the same option, pilgrims would understand, \"Okay, now I shouldn't expect to go inside the mosque; I should focus on the courtyard.\" Would such crowdsourced information be helpful?\n[28:53] Zohora Khanam: It would definitely be helpful, it would certainly be helpful. Another point is the language barrier. Because it's seen that not everyone performing Hajj is educated, and not everyone knows Arabic. If it were in common English, even then, many are illiterate or lack the capacity to understand. Now, if it were in one's own country's language, meaning in Bengali for us, that might be better. Another problem could arise if any message is broadcast in a crowded situation. What happens there is that if a gate is closed, it doesn't stay closed for the entire day. Perhaps it was closed at the time I sent the message. But after a little while, the police open it again. It becomes open again. Perhaps people didn't follow me and went another way, only to find that other way closed, and then the first one became open again. This could lead to miscommunication. Because the situation there, especially in Haram Sharif, with the police and authorities, doesn't remain static. It constantly changes randomly. They might open a road now, then barricade it within five minutes, and then open another one a few minutes later, and so on. That's why there might be some confusion about how effective this communication would be. It's a good initiative if it happens, but it doesn't really stay constant. It changes continuously. By the time I receive the message, the situation might have already changed. If I proceed based on that message, I might find myself in a different position. For this reason, how acceptable it would be cannot really be understood without an experiment.\n[30:57] Muhammad: Okay, now coming to the language aspect, when you were shopping or dealing with the local community in Mecca and Madinah, did you feel that language was a problem?\n[31:07] Zohora Khanam: Language wasn't much of a problem. The reason is that there's a huge Bengali community working in Saudi Arabia, especially in the shops. Yes, there's a slight problem with transportation, especially when we went to Madinah, where there were very few Bengali drivers. Most of them were drivers speaking other languages. That was a bit of a problem. But for shopping, it wasn't. In every shop, you'd find Bengali salesmen. It's manageable; it's not a major problem.\n[31:43] Muhammad: If there was something like this, for instance, if you had urgent instructions, like \"I'm going to the hotel,\" \"I need to buy food,\" or \"Which way is the direction?\"—these kinds of day-to-day language matters—and you communicated them through an app that translated it, showed it to the person you're talking to, or conveyed it via voice message. Have you ever used such a translate feature?\n[32:14] Zohora Khanam: No, no, I never had the opportunity to do that.\n[32:16] Muhammad: Would you have done it if you knew such a thing existed?\n[32:20] Zohora Khanam: I don't have a clear idea about that, actually.\n[32:23] Muhammad: Okay.\n[32:23] Muhammad: Now, let's talk about the days of Hajj. How were your preparations and logistics during the Hajj days?\n[32:32] Zohora Khanam: For the days of Hajj, the preparation – that is, the preparation we have when we leave our country, there's a mental preparation from then on. The Hajj days would be like this, meaning we would have to be in that way. Whether in Arafat Madani or Mina, and then when we go to stone the Jamarat, we had an idea beforehand of what kind of huge crowds there would be, how to manage, how to proceed. We had an idea about these things. But when we went, by the grace of Allah, Alhamdulillah, we didn't face any complex major problems, apart from minor ones like the immense crowd, which we had to face. However, in terms of transport, there was a big crisis, like when everyone rushes from Muzdalifah in the morning. Other than these minor issues, there were no major problems. And regarding logistics, we had pretty much all the necessary logistics, and we were told in the orientation what kind of logistics to take. In some cases, we took extra logistics, to the point that it felt like we could have managed with less, given the amount of bedding and other items we carried. Carrying all that is quite a struggle, especially when you have to walk a lot. If I carry a big luggage with me, it's difficult. So, in hindsight, I felt that taking a little less logistics would have been fine. There was sufficient provision there.\n[34:10] Muhammad: Okay. Here, I'll share a few things. Places like Arafat and Muzdalifah are very sacred. Each of them has specific rulings and injunctions. There are specific supplications for each place. The Prophet [PBUH] made supplications at certain special spots in each place. Did you have a list of these? Where did he go? For example, the significance of the mosque where the Khutbah (sermon) of Arafat in Mina takes place. Then, there's a mosque in Mina; its significance. Then there are some mosques. And then, the supplications there. Did you have any of these from your end?\n[34:55] Zohora Khanam: We had an idea of the basic supplications, those were with us.\n[34:58] Muhammad: No, by Duas, I mean the supplications you would make to Allah, your own personal Duas. Did you take those in a list format?\n[35:06] Zohora Khanam: No, they weren't taken in a list format like that. So now, if there was something like what I mentioned, say you went to Arafat, you went to Mina, and there you learned about their significance, how the Prophet [PBUH] did things, by being there and experiencing it.\n[35:28] Muhammad: When you are actually going to those spots, you see and learn why they were significant, what the Sunnah practices were. Plus, if you were given a Dua book within the app itself, where you could add your beneficial Duas via voice or by typing them yourself, so you could recite them. Would this benefit your Duas if you had it?\n[35:57] Zohora Khanam: Yes, absolutely, it would be beneficial because one doesn't always remember everything by heart. The memory (pause) yes. And then, instead of wasting time looking at a book, if I have an app, when I go to a particular point, if I open the app, I can instantly know what to do. This would be very easy for me. I would definitely say it would be a very good support.\n[36:26] Muhammad: So, were there any other challenges beyond what we've discussed regarding your overall Hajj experience?\n[36:31] Zohora Khanam: There weren't any major challenges. For instance, during Hajj, suddenly, regarding timings, as you said, through an app, when should I go to Jamarat to find it a bit less crowded? Or, for Hajj, what time is Mina free? When should I move from Mina to get transport? If such information was available. Yes. And then, the transport, sometimes the transport isn't fixed. For example, when we came from Mina to Muzdalifah, the bus support, sometimes the drivers would miss the road location. The drivers, being from different language backgrounds, also didn't know the locations well. Then, there was this tension, this challenge, of reaching a specific spot at the right time to perform a prayer. Our group also had people who couldn't reach on time. They had to perform Isha and Maghrib very late, or some couldn't perform it at all. This kind of hesitation remains, that it's a challenge. It's about reaching a spot on time and managing it. And then, at what time should I go to Jamarat to perform the ritual smoothly? Such information wasn't available. We went based on our own understanding. Sometimes we found ourselves in immense crowds, sometimes it was free. A small incident occurred. Yes. We received instant messages about that incident. We went to where the crowd was, and then we found out that a small fire had broken out in a tent in Mina, causing a huge crowd, and all transport was stopped. If such messages were available, everyone would wonder why the transport was stopped, but there were no messages. If these messages were available time to time through an app or something, yes, whether from the Saudi government or our agency, like \"Don't go here now because this problem is happening,\" if such updated information was available, I think these challenges wouldn't exist. Otherwise, Alhamdulillah, there were no other major challenges. No such problems occurred, by the grace of Allah.\n[38:52] Muhammad: Okay? So, you've performed Hajj, and now, regarding your lifestyle, how can we use mobile app technology to maintain the spirit of Hajj? To ensure that the post-Hajj life is better than the pre-Hajj life for pilgrims.\n[39:12] Zohora Khanam: The post-Hajj life certainly changes somewhat from the pre-Hajj life. Yes. When Hajj is done, a certain mindset develops in people. The thought of performing our five daily prayers, our obligatory acts, comes to mind. Everyone tries to do this. Then, regarding religious duties, if there is an opportunity for updates, like what we need to do after Hajj, which we might have heard about but could miss in some cases. If there's an app that tells me, \"You need to do this,\" and I go to the app and see what my next steps are and how to continue them, where there are opportunities to do better, I think that helps. In all cases, when there is continuity, it's easier to perform tasks. When there's an information gap, when I'm not aware, then there's a gap in the practice. For example, if I'm praying regularly, and I hear every day, \"Yes, I've performed Hajj, so I must pray five times a day, no matter how busy I am.\" When this thought is constantly put into my mind through some message, it will be even more active. If there are no messages, gradually, I might lose momentum. Similarly, if I continuously receive messages or have an app for other Islamic duties, like how mobile companies send messages about various national or updated events, \"Today is this day, that day,\" I might not remember it, but then a notification reminds me, \"Yes, today is this day, this is the matter of today.\" If there's such a continuous process for those who have performed Hajj, if pilgrims keep receiving messages from time to time about what needs to be observed after Hajj, \"Have you done this after Hajj? This is Fard (obligatory), this is Sunnah (Prophetic tradition), this is essential,\" if such continuous messages keep coming, when a message arrives, we will definitely read it, and reading it will make me think. If such things exist, I believe it can beautifully maintain the continuity.\n[41:40] Muhammad: So, if you had an app of this kind, first of all, if you or someone else were to go for Hajj again in the future, your Hajj training modules would be there, all the Hajj rituals would be listed, Umrah rituals would be there. You'd find places for shopping, places for Ziyarah. Your guide would provide guidance information through the app, and after Hajj, you would receive small reminder programs on your mobile. [42:21] Muhammad: Would you use such an app as a paid app, or do you think it should be a free app?\n[42:30] Zohora Khanam: If you consider purchasing something, you see you have to take [best guess: a kit] or renew it. If it's a one-time fee, I think it's possible to take it. And if it's free, it will certainly be adopted. Especially for those who have performed Hajj, if it's like this: they will give an app, install it for them, and if we take a SIM like that on our mobile, not a Saudi SIM but a Bangladeshi SIM, and there's an app on it, if it's included in the Hajj fee we pay, then I don't think it will feel like an extra cost. For Hajj, we spend a total amount including money for food, logistics, everything. The agency takes money from us there. If they include the payment for this app in that, as a one-time fee, and the app is given to you for life, I don't think it will be a burden. But if after Hajj, they say you have to pay this much for it, some might be hesitant.\n[43:45] Muhammad: I think if a one-year subscription for Hajj is purchased, and after Hajj, say you remain connected with the app for one year, and after one year, you've completed Hajj, then your connection to the community is free. But if you go for Hajj or Umrah again later, after a year, then you would have to pay a small fee again. Does that seem fair to you?\n[44:17] Zohora Khanam: Yes, that's fair. And if it's not taken as an extra, but included once with the Hajj package, I think that would be very good.\n[44:27] Muhammad: What amount do you think would be reasonable? What amount of money do you think would be okay?\n[44:33] Zohora Khanam: The amount should be such that it doesn't make the package, which comes in different categories now, too expensive. It shouldn't be an amount that varies the package too much.\n[44:48] Muhammad: If it's, say, one thousand, fifteen hundred, two thousand?\n[44:51] Zohora Khanam: Yes, I don't think that would affect it much. It's not a very large amount. I think two, three, four thousand is not a huge sum.\n[45:01] Muhammad: If the agency were to adjust it with other costs, like food expenses, there are many costs in the package, aren't there? If they adjust it there, then those who are going for Hajj wouldn't even realize that they're paying extra for it. They could beautifully set it within the package itself. [45:30] Muhammad: Last question. After Hajj, you are planning to perform Umrah, perhaps you shared that with me. When you go for Umrah, will you just book hotels and plane tickets yourself, like you do for other travels, and come back after performing Umrah, or will you go through an agency?\n[46:04] Zohora Khanam: I haven't thought about that yet. I have a desire, we have a desire, and if Allah fulfills it, if Allah grants the opportunity, there is a wish to go again. The plan for how we'll go or through whom we'll go, no concrete decision has been made yet. And there's no plan to do it next year either. There's just a desire, and if Allah accepts it and fulfills this desire, I will go, Insha'Allah. And whether I'll go through an agency or arrange it myself, I haven't really thought about that yet.\n[46:42] Muhammad: If you were asked to do it this way, to travel directly yourself, like people travel to other places, booking tickets and hotels, would you feel confident, or would you feel some fear?\n[46:53] Zohora Khanam: No, I don't think I would feel completely confident. Perhaps for booking plane tickets or hotels, I wouldn't feel completely confident. I think some support would be needed. Meaning, an agency arranges everything for you, but they don't give you live guidance there; you do things your own way. Or does the agency take you on a fully guided tour?\n[47:20] Muhammad: For Umrah, actually, you don't really need that much; but I think some guidance is needed, you know.\n[47:28] Zohora Khanam: For visiting Ziyarah spots, or for staying in hotels, and food, these things would definitely require some support. Doing it completely individually would be a bit difficult, I think.\n[47:43] Muhammad: If you imagine that the agency arranged everything for you and also bought you the app, then in that case, you would use the app to find your Ziyarah spots. The agency would arrange a driver for you, and the driver would pick you up from the hotel. And in that scenario, when you arrive at the Ziyarah spot, you would learn why this spot is significant by watching audio and video clips.\n[48:10] Zohora Khanam: Yes, that would be possible, that would be possible. If it's not alone but with other group members, I mean, if there are two or three family members, it's possible to do it oneself. Because often, outside of Hajj, when we travel abroad for leisure, we always book hotels and everything ourselves. But here, some support is needed because one might make a mistake in religious matters, right?\n[48:50] Zohora Khanam: Since I won't get the opportunity to go repeatedly, if I make a mistake once, it will be a regret for a lifetime. That's why having a guide increases confidence, knowing that if I go now, I need to perform this type of worship, and recite this Dua there. Someone is guiding me. But if I know everything through the app – where to go, what Dua to recite, what kind of worship to perform, how to go from one place to another – and if there's also a list of transport support, which driver to contact, which hotel to stay in, then I don't think continuous guidance is needed. It can definitely be done by oneself, Insha'Allah.\n[49:50] Muhammad: Okay. Thank you very much for your time. We'll conclude the interview here. Insha'Allah. Assalamu Alaikum.\n[49:57] Zohora Khanam: Wa alaikum assalam, thank you."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: [00:00] Assalamu Alaikum, so Abdur Rahman Bhai, if you could please introduce yourself first.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Yes.\nMuhammad: [00:00] If you could start by introducing yourself, who are you? Please start with your name.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] My name is Abdur Rahman.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] I am a Canboard staff, you are a mosque attendant, Abdur Rahman.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Abdur Rahman Bhai, you have performed Hajj twice, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Thrice.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, which years did you perform Hajj?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] 2010, 16, and 24.\nMuhammad: [00:00] 24. Okay, brother, have you ever been for Umrah?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] No, I haven't been for Umrah. Did you perform Hajj all three times through the same agency? So, what was your experience with the agency through which you performed Hajj? Did the agency deliver everything they promised? Was the experience good? It was good. One minute, yes.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, so that means Abdur Rahman Bhai, you performed Hajj three times: in 2010, 2016, and 2024. And you performed Hajj all three times through separate agencies, and you found the service of each agency to be good, Alhamdulillah, right? Inshallah.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay. So, what was your cost for Hajj, Abdur Rahman Bhai?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] When I first went in 2010, it cost 2 lakh 30.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Hmm.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] After that...\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Yes.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] When I went in 2016, my cost was around 2 lakh 60, no, 1 lakh 60-70.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Oh, wow.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] This time, I went for someone else's Badali Hajj (Hajj by proxy), and they paid the full amount.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] The full 6 lakh Taka, so to speak.\nMuhammad: [00:00] So, for these three times you went, did you choose the agency yourself, or did people choose it for you, telling you which agency to go with?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] No, the agency through whom I went twice, he has been known to me since childhood. He has led Tarawih prayers at our mosque for 19-20 years. He has been taking Hajj pilgrims for 20 years. Before him, Gani Saab used to take pilgrims. I didn't go before; if I had known earlier, maybe in 2010, I would have gone with him. (Muhammad: Oh, I see.) So, when you went with him, did he provide the hotel and car as promised? Everything was as agreed, right? Yes, everything was fine, no problem with that. However, the first time I went, the agency did not provide transportation. They provided two meals.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] And they accommodated us a bit far away, near the Mezphala Bridge.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Mezphala Bridge, near Mezphala Bridge, there's a Keduya Bridge, hmm.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] He accommodated us right next to the Keduya Bridge, in that building. Many of our Hajj brothers, those government pilgrims, were also kept there.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nMuhammad: [00:00] I understand. So, Abdullah...\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Anyway, the two times I went with him, in 2024, I stayed right behind the Zamzam Tower, at Areezul Fala Hotel. As soon as you finish the [inaudible] courtyard, cross the road, it's on this side. Areezul Fala Hotel. This time in 2024, you saw it. (Muhammad: I understand.) Abdur Rahman Bhai, when you were there, how did they communicate with you about plans, like what to do today, tomorrow, or what rituals to perform?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] They did all this in a hall room at the residence.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Or in a huge dining room. Everyone would gather in the huge dining room, and they would consult there. There were two or three people: one president, one vice-president, and another person who took full responsibility for the president's work. So, they told us what to do and when, in this manner.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Did they use WhatsApp with you?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] No, we didn't use WhatsApp. Because we didn't feel it was necessary.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay. So, when you were in your room, if they called for some reason or had something to announce, how would you get the news that everyone should come to the dining room for a meeting? How would you get this news?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] We would tell the other Hajj brothers.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Oh, so one person would tell another.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Everyone used to go for prayers, didn't we?\nMuhammad: [00:00] Yes.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] When we went for prayers, we would all come down and sit together. When we sat down, they would say, \"Tomorrow,\" or \"Today,\" or \"After Fajr prayer\" – after Fajr prayer, we would all sleep.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] They would give a time for breakfast. Right after breakfast, at 10:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, they would tell everyone to be present in that room on the third floor, like that.\nMuhammad: [00:00] I see. Do you think it would have been easier if they used WhatsApp or a mobile app here?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] I don't think it's necessary.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] As far as I understand, sometimes there's no internet, sometimes no Wi-Fi. These things create more problems and distance.\nMuhammad: [00:00] I understand. Okay, so when you were there, did you go around buying things, sightseeing, or eating out, or did you just stay at the hotel and eat what they provided?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] He (the guide/agency) did what was necessary; he took us around to different places, as they say. As for my shopping, it was up to each person's desire and means. He told us not to carry more than 50 kg, saying that if it exceeded this limit, he wouldn't be able to do anything about it.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, so you bought those from... from around the Haram, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] I bought from Madinah. I bought from Madinah, I bought from Makkah.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay. And you didn't use any smartphone, mobile, or anything throughout the entire trip, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] I had my mobile with me, but I didn't use it for any other purpose.\nMuhammad: [00:00] I see. You don't use a smartphone, you use a button phone. When I went in 2010, I had a button phone.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] And when I went later, both times I had a smartphone.\nMuhammad: [00:00] So, on your smartphone, many people carry duas, instructions on what to do, and watch Hajj and Umrah videos from YouTube. Did you watch any of these?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] No, none of those were needed.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Oh, okay, so you had everything memorized, meaning you had studied beforehand, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Yes.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, okay, I understand. So, what do you think, is it good to have a smartphone, or does it cause more trouble?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] It's trouble, I think. Those who carry mobiles, they cause more disturbance.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] What kind of disturbance? It rings during prayers. After that, and after that, there is a lot, a lot of disturbance.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] This is what I've understood from my experience, in my sense. And it's not just mobiles. People bring small children.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay. When they bring children, they cry and scream, meaning it becomes difficult to concentrate on prayers. The children cry and scream so loudly, it's unbearable.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, what if it's like this, Abdur Rahman Bhai: you need your mobile for many things, like talking to people back home. So you take your mobile, and it has a du'a app, a Hajj app. When you turn on that app, for example, if you're doing Tawaf, or Sa'i, or you're in the mosque reading the Quran, everything is in that app. And when the app is on, you won't get any calls or notifications; nothing will come through. This app will just run there, like a \"Do Not Disturb\" mode on your mobile. And when you leave the mosque, you turn off the app, and then calls and everything else will come through again. And let's say the agencies could do this: if agencies send you any important messages, or if there's any message from the Makkah government, that would also come to your app, and you could see if there's a crowd in the courtyard at any time, or how crowded the Tawaf area is. So, if there was an app like this, do you think it would be good, or would it still be a hassle?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] In my opinion, from what I've seen, no matter how many apps there are, they don't let us enter on time.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Because of that, even if we go out an hour and a half earlier, we see them closing the roads. They close the roads, make us run around a lot, and then let us in.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] This side remains empty. So, these apps are no use for getting in.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] The police do things like that. Because in my two-three years of experience, this is what I've found and understood.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] But what if it's provided like this now?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] In 2010, when I went, I didn't understand that much. Or even after that, I still didn't understand some things. But then I saw and understood many things by walking around alone. Because of this, I believe it's better not to use mobiles.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay. I understand.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] What happens is, people are doing Tawaf, taking selfies. Entering Haram, taking selfies. Entering various places, going there and taking selfies. Now everyone is a \"selfie Hajj.\" Everyone is now a \"selfie Hajj.\" From what I've seen so far, everyone is a \"selfie Hajj.\" This selfie thing has become a business for everyone. When we stand for prayer inside the Haram, near Maqam Ibrahim, a person next to me talks on the phone, \"I'm here now, in front of the Haram door, I'm standing for prayer.\" He's saying it on the mobile. What's the need for that? You're saying it, you're saying you're praying, Allah is seeing you on the spot, is there a need to say this? (Muhammad: I understand, I understand.) You think it's a hassle to be there, right? (Muhammad: I understand.) Okay, so before going, there's training, right? For Hajj, before going, there's training. For that training, you have to go to the office, right?\nMuhammad: [00:00] So, instead of having that training there in person, what if they told you to join through WhatsApp or this app, and all the training videos would be there? Not live training, but all recorded videos. You could watch all the videos at your own convenience, learning how to perform Tawaf, Sa'i, etc.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] The reason for taking the training, the reason for taking the training, is twofold. One is to know who I am going with, who is going with me. First, to get acquainted and meet them.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Hmm. Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] And to be told everything about my Hajj matters, meaning, what I will do today, what I will do tomorrow, what I will do the day after tomorrow, all of it is informed and told. And they tell these things simultaneously; one person says, and we play along with him. After that, this is to give us an idea, that's all. If it's given through an app, it's like watching on Facebook and listening, that's it. After that, you can't really talk back.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, I understand.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] People don't get to meet each other, to know who is going with me, where they are from, where I am from, there's no introduction in that place. It's not like a sermon; it's about meeting each other, getting acquainted, knowing each other, that's all. And if both exist, you...\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Within Hajj, what I've understood in these three years, the most important thing is patience. Whoever has patience will be able to perform a Hajj Mabrur (accepted Hajj). Otherwise, their Hajj will not be Mabrur if they don't have patience. For those who lack patience, Hajj is not for them. Who is with the patient? Allah is with them. Allah Himself has promised to be with the patient. Allah says, \"I myself am with the patient.\" And those who cause too much trouble or problems, nothing will work with them.\nMuhammad: [00:00] I understand. Okay, Abdur Rahman Bhai, now you took the training there, that's fine. But after taking the training, in Dhaka city, there's a lot of traffic on the roads, right? How many times did you go for training?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] I went for training only once. They say it's one day, from morning until 5 PM. They also provide breakfast in the morning and arrange lunch at noon.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay. So for you, since you've gone three times, it's easy. But for those who are going for the first time, especially women, is a one-day training actually sufficient for them? Or do you think it would be better if they could see it several times, perhaps through video recordings?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] By \"sufficient,\" I mean they study there. They give some Hajj books and guidebooks, and then by looking at those, they learn what to do at what time. The main Hajj activities begin on the 7th of Dhul Hijjah. For example, they take you to Mina on the 7th or 8th. On the 9th morning, they go to the plain of Arafat, or they leave at night. If they leave at night, they stay in Arafat all day on the 9th. After sunset, everyone immediately goes to Muzdalifah. They stay in Muzdalifah all night. On the 10th of Dhul Hijjah, everyone returns from Muzdalifah to Jamarat. At Jamarat, they stone the big devil, throwing seven pebbles first. After throwing seven, what do they have to do? They have to sacrifice. After sacrificing, they become lawful; they shave their heads, or trim their hair. So this is the first part of the Hajj activities. The second day, they have to throw 21 pebbles, and the third day, they have to throw 21 pebbles. And within this, they have to perform the obligatory Tawaf and Sa'i. If someone can do it on the first day, fine; if not, they can do it on the second day, Inshallah. But on the first day, they must throw pebbles and perform the sacrifice. If they don't sacrifice, they cannot become lawful, right? They can't shave their head until the sacrifice is done. (Muhammad: I understand.) Okay, Abdur Rahman Bhai, throughout this entire Hajj journey, if I were to ask you to name five things that were the most challenging and difficult for you and for the pilgrims in your group, what would those five things be?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Huh?\nMuhammad: [00:00] If I were to ask you to name five things in your entire Hajj journey that were the most challenging for you and for the pilgrims in your group, what would those five things be?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Five things. Number one is throwing pebbles. This is a very challenging thing.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Hmm. Why is that challenging?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Throwing pebbles.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Why is it challenging? Why is it challenging?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] It's challenging because everyone rushes from Arafat and Muzdalifah, and they have to stand in various places. The Saudi police block off this side, and that side, they don't let people go, they don't release them, they hold people back. This is a big problem.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Second, there's the issue of sacrifice for millions of pilgrims.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Yes.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Okay. Millions of sacrifices. They cannot become lawful. I don't even know. Those who do it through banks, in my opinion, it's not correct in any way. Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Okay.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] But if it's done through people, then no matter how, they sacrifice within a single day.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, at 10 PM. When I went for Hajj in 2010, our Hajj group had 86 people, yes.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] As many as 86 people were there. We then went very far, as far as Tangail, in cars, for the sacrifice. I consider the sacrifice issue very complicated. Many people lie about it, many don't believe. They just go and say they didn't sacrifice, but claim they did. (Muhammad: I understand.)\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, so those two were throwing pebbles and sacrifice. What about the other three things you would mention as major difficulties for you?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Many of the staff are not familiar with the routes. Those who know and are familiar, they walk through the inner paths. Many don't know this and wait. Those who know the way, they go to the left. Because of this, many get lost while performing Fard (obligatory rituals). They get lost in the Haram and can't find their way back to Mina. What to do then? Based on my three years of experience, I'm telling you what I saw: many of our pilgrims got lost like this. We found them near a bank, Al Rajhi Bank, at a corner.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Okay, its name... The fourth one is that many people struggle with food during Hajj. The local food, which they call 'Khachcha' or something, pilgrims can't eat it. Mostly, they serve Ruh fish, chicken, and other miscellaneous items. But people from our country are used to spicy food, while their food is often sweet. So many people have problems with this; they get stomach upsets, gas, and can't eat. Many other problems arise.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, I understand. Tell me one more thing that you think is difficult, something that truly causes pilgrims hardship.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] These are the things that cause pilgrims the most hardship, as I mentioned.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, Abdur Rahman Bhai, now you mentioned things like pilgrims getting lost, and the sacrifice. What if, for example, Saudi authorities perform sacrifices through a mobile app? You gave money through a bank, just like you went and sacrificed, and the app informed you that your sacrifice has been completed. Then, when going to the Haram, the app shows you the way, telling you which route to take. It might say, \"It's too crowded today, don't go today. Everyone went today, go tomorrow.\" If you have three days, go tomorrow. Such information is provided via the app: which days are more or less crowded. You can simply see it. Okay. Then, when you go to perform Tawaf in the Haram, you're at the Mataf, and you see live camera feeds of how crowded it is. You can decide whether to perform Tawaf on the ground floor or the first floor, or where. And getting lost is very common. If there's a mobile app, you won't get lost. Someone can call you or send you a message, and they can see your location. If these kinds of emergency features are available in a mobile app, do you think people would use it?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] My...\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] I don't think so, but if something like that exists, it can be tried.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, and would this make it easier for the agencies?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Sir.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Yes, these are minor things, some of them are already available through agencies.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] For example, if someone gets lost, they give a number, the number on the visa. They give this number, local numbers, these numbers. Many times, people keep calling and calling until they are exhausted. The phone isn't picked up, it's not answered. That's why I'm saying, for me, it's easier and better to manage it on the spot, without a mobile.\nMuhammad: [00:00] I understand. What if, for example, your visa and all your documents are printed in the app? If you get lost somewhere, you show it to a cleric or a guard there, saying, \"This is my visa.\" They seat you somewhere, and there's a button you press. Then the agency owner gets a notification that \"My pilgrim is lost here and sitting.\" They send you a message saying, \"Please stay here, we'll be there in an hour or two to pick you up.\" Then you'd feel a sense of peace of mind, wouldn't you? What do you say, can something like this be done?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] One can try. Maybe it will work. If it works, I understand this much: at that time, there is a lot of crowd, it's impossible. And if other pilgrims say, \"We told one pilgrim we'd pick them up, and gave them a time, saying it would take an hour to arrive. You sit here, we're coming from Makkah.\" They sit in Makkah. \"We're coming from Mina.\" It took until 2 AM to arrive. Until 2 AM, they sat in front of Al Rajhi Bank, saying, \"Please come and pick me up.\" They don't even know the Makkah residence. They say, \"Go to our Makkah hotel.\" The person says, \"I don't even know the hotel.\" Two people came to throw pebbles, and they threw pebbles correctly. But after throwing pebbles, what they did was go straight to Makkah to perform the obligatory ritual. Now they are lost in Makkah. They walked all day, they're exhausted now. I told them to eat something, pour water on their head, and do this and that. It was also hot at 2 AM, coming from Mina.\nMuhammad: [00:00] They can't speak Arabic to anyone, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] No, no. They don't speak Arabic, and they don't understand English. That's why I'm saying, many Saudis also don't understand the mobile phone system.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Oh, so for that reason, if everything is written in Arabic, if they show it to a police officer, he can say, \"This pilgrim is lost,\" and if he presses, \"I'm lost,\" then if you show the police in Arabic writing, \"This pilgrim is lost, send this pilgrim to the hotel,\" then. Would that be convenient for him?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] What we've thought would be best is to use the Bangladeshi Hajj workers who are employed there.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Yes, if you use them, if you go to them, it makes things easier and faster to reach your destination. They speak Bengali, they speak Arabic, they say whatever needs to be said, they give directions. They say, \"He's at such-and-such place, you come to such-and-such place.\" I have received the most cooperation from these Hajj workers; they are the best.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, brother, the Bangladeshi Hajj workers who are there, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Yes, yes, yes. There are many Bangladeshi Hajj workers in Makkah, Madinah, and also in Mina, on the plains of Arafat; many of them are deployed there.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, can Bangladeshi, Indian, and Pakistani people help if they speak in Urdu or Hindi?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] If you speak, they do help. They tell as much as they know; beyond that, they don't say.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Oh, okay, Abdur Rahman Bhai, how old are you? Are you 60 plus?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Yes, currently 60 plus.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay. So, in your group, were there young pilgrims, like 30, 35, 40, below 50 years old?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Yes, many were below 50.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Many pilgrims were there.\nMuhammad: [00:00] So, those pilgrims in their 40s and 50s, did they use mobiles, laptops, or did they not use them much?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] No, they didn't use mobiles much. They used them this much: they went, came back to the residence, came to the hotel, went downstairs, found a Wi-Fi connection, and talked to their families. They were all busy talking. And they would say, \"We finished our Eid prayer. We finished our Isha prayer. Now we'll go upstairs to the room, eat, and sleep.\" That's it. They would talk about these things. They would ask about home. \"How's Dhaka?\" They would inquire about Dhaka. And at that time, I was there both times, I used to see a lot of Awami League people. These would appear on TV.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, Abdur Rahman Bhai, I learned many things from you about how you managed Hajj, the hotel, everything. So, Inshallah, I have heard your words, Inshallah, I have recorded them, and Inshallah, this will be a very beneficial work for me.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Okay.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, brother, yes.\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Inshallah, we had many young pilgrims with us.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Yes, people aged 30, 22, 26. Many young boys and girls of 30, 22, 26 were there. They were young. They were good. They used mobile apps for prayers and the Quran. When they went to Madinah, they used the app to go to Jannatul Baqi and Riyazul Jannah, but nowhere else. Oh, I see. I understand. They didn't allow entry through the app; they used it there. They didn't use it anywhere else. I understand. They used our guide's number, and then they were given specific times, \"at such and such time, on such and such day, on such and such date.\" They went at that time. I understand. You didn't buy phone SIMs, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] No, I bought a SIM, I bought a SIM.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Oh, you bought a Saudi SIM, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] A mobile SIM.\nMuhammad: [00:00] So, the SIM had internet, you didn't use the internet, right?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] I had internet for a short while, as long as I had balance, I had internet.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Internet. What did you mainly use the internet for?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] I used the internet for talking on my mobile; I could talk for so many minutes using the internet. Even after that was finished, I could still talk. So, the internet was used for this.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Oh, so you used it for talking, nothing else?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Yes, yes, only for talking.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Okay, now if you were offered a SIM from Bangladesh for your mobile, and you could only use it to talk in that country, not for Facebook, YouTube, or anything else. Which SIM would you buy then? The Saudi SIM is much cheaper. Would you buy it then?\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] If there's a benefit, I would buy it. I think pilgrims would want to take it if they get such a benefit, Inshallah.\nMuhammad: [00:00] So, talking seems very important to you. Everyone's patience...\nAbdur Rahman: [00:00] Yes, talking. For example, I used to call home once a day, sometimes twice, sometimes every other day. Besides that, I also called others whom I remembered and felt like talking to. I asked about their well-being, how the elders were doing. Okay, Abdur Rahman Bhai, these are the things I needed. Inshallah, we'll talk again later, Inshallah.\nMuhammad: [00:00] Inshallah."

    "english_transcript": "[00:00] Muhammad: Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikum Assalam. How are you, brother? [00:01] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Alhamdulillah, brother. [00:02] Muhammad: Let me give a little context. The purpose of this meeting is that I am participating in an accelerator program called Hasan VC, which is a Malaysia-based startup. The program is called Hasan Studio. As part of that, I am researching the global Hajj and Umrah market and interviewing Bangladeshis who work with Hajj and Umrah. So, my goal here is mainly to talk with you as a travel agency owner, get your perspective, understand the market a bit, and grasp the main challenges you face that technology could solve. For the convenience of note-taking, I will Inshallah record this meeting. Inshallah, I hope there's no issue with this, right? [00:54] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Hmm. No, what will you use this recording for? Don't use it for marketing. [00:58] Muhammad: No, not for marketing. This will be purely for my own research. And the insights from this meeting's recording will perhaps be shared with Hasan VC, under whom I am working. They might assess the quality of my market research for that purpose. But for marketing or anything else, Inshallah [it won't be used]. [01:17] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Who is Mohammad? [01:19] Muhammad: It's a recorder. That's it. It's a recorder. [01:22] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Tell me. [01:23] Muhammad: Okay, brother, let's start by asking your agency's name. Your agency's name and how long you've been working. Let's start our first question with that.\n[01:31] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: My agency's name is Travel Trick BD. I've had this company for three years, but I've been in this trade for more than 22 years. [01:39] Muhammad: So our main focus today is on Hajj and Umrah. As far as I know, you might not be offering Hajj packages now, but mainly you have a lot of customers who are buying Umrah packages from you. [01:49] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Right. [01:50] Muhammad: So, for Umrah, do you offer group packages or also customized individual packages? [01:54] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: We do group packages, and we also do individual. [01:57] Muhammad: So, what's your busiest time for Umrah?\n[02:00] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Hmm? Hmm. [02:02] Muhammad: Umrah season? [02:03] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: The main Umrah season is December, January. And that time. Ramadan. [02:11] Muhammad: When you handle Umrah groups and when you run them, do you have sub-agents or group leaders, or do the pilgrims work directly with you? [02:22] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: I didn't understand. The question again. [02:24] Muhammad: I mean, when you do marketing, do you market through group leaders or sub-agents, or do you market directly to the pilgrims? [02:30] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No, there are two things here. One is B2B, and the other is B2C. For B2B, it's definitely done through other agents or others.\n[02:39] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: We send our offers to our known agents who take Umrah services. And for B2C, we communicate directly with the pilgrims. [02:46] Muhammad: I understand, I understand. Now, on average, what are your lowest Umrah packages, and what's the highest price they go up to? [02:53] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: It depends on what's in the market, and mine isn't fixed. In the market, it starts from 1 lakh 25-30 [thousand BDT] for regular hotels far away. I don't do that. My client base isn't at that level. Okay. Sir, some have done 3 lakh 60, 3 lakh 80 [thousand BDT]. So, there's a difference like that. [03:10] Muhammad: Okay. So, you're saying that usually in the market, packages around 1 lakh or 1.5 lakh [BDT] have hotels far away. You do premium packages where hotels are closer. What's the minimum cost for your packages?\n[03:26] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: 1 lakh 50 minimum. [03:28] Muhammad: So, it starts from over 1.5 lakh and goes up to about 3 lakh, 3 lakh [BDT]? I understand, I understand. You do packages between 1.5 lakh and 4 lakh, depending on the duration, like 10 days. I understand. So, brother, what are your biggest challenges when you create these packages? For example, if we talk about margin, competition, selling group packages, and getting services from there. What are the main challenges that agencies face from your perspective?\n[04:22] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: What I face is with the airport, getting a car at the airport. It's a hassle. Their arrival. Sometimes they offer free, free transfer. They offer free transfer, representatives do. But it's not actually free. If you take that, the agency gets a big amount deducted, a penalty. That's a hassle. Sometimes, for the agency, there was one last thing, transportation. Then there's another. Okay. [04:54] Muhammad: I see. So, airport logistics is a big problem for you. Hello? Yes, no problem. So, you're saying the main problem is airport logistics. And in this case, besides airport logistics, other things, especially like market competition, and the reliability of service providers in Makkah and Madinah, you've sorted these out, right? I understand. Can this be shared? Usually, when you operate your Umrah packages, what percentage margin do you keep? For example, roughly, if it's 1 lakh BDT, how much profit margin do you assume for an Umrah package?\n[05:52] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: It depends. [05:55] Muhammad: It depends on the package. [05:56] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: It's not fixed. [05:57] Muhammad: If you take a range? [06:00] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No. [06:01] Muhammad: Yes. [06:02] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No. [06:03] Muhammad: Can we take a range like 5 or 10 to 20 or? [06:05] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Minimum 5. [06:07] Muhammad: Okay, makes sense. So now, you mentioned you work with B2B agents. Yes. When communicating with B2B agents, managing them, do you use any system, or just plain WhatsApp and Google Sheets? [06:21] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes, for now, I use WhatsApp. I have WhatsApp groups. I use WhatsApp groups. And my portal is getting ready for the B2B channel. They will log in there and find everything there. They will get it through that. It's under development.\n[06:40] Muhammad: Okay. So, you're already working on a B2B under development. Great. Okay. So, this is another thing. Let me share this now. So, you prefer B2B. Now, you're developing it yourself. What if a third party comes to you and says they will provide you with a complete software? You'll have no upfront cost. You'll pay a monthly fee, like we do for YouTube or Facebook subscriptions, and they will handle both your B2B and B2C through one portal. This would include marketing for B2B and B2C, plus B2B agents and B2C customer management. Would you be interested in buying such a service? How would it work?\n[07:46] Muhammad: For example, you'll have a portal. You'll upload your packages there. There will be B2B rates and B2C rates for those packages. And your B2B partners will be able to log in there, see your B2B rates, and purchase directly from you. In that case, your leads will go directly to your internal system. And for B2C, it will be like booking.com or Agoda. They won't need to log in to your system. They will be able to see all your advertised packages. And if they want, they can query your phone number from there or send their phone number to you. It will come as a lead in your system. And you can call them directly. If someone provides you with such a system, would you use it? [08:44] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No, what I'm doing is this system. Hmm, very.\n[08:50] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes. [08:51] Muhammad: And B2B, I am also trying to do that. It needs some more development. Some more work is going on. Once it's up, my marketing will also be active. Brother, what you're doing, you can say it's like your system. Yes. For example, I saw your website, tripbdnet. But here, you have to manage everything completely. So, here, the upfront cost, your management, everything is yours, and you built it with WordPress. Is this WordPress or what is it? [09:27] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: OS, where are you seeing it? Where are you seeing it? [09:30] Muhammad: I was looking at... oh, traveltrickbd.com. Oh, I thought so. Yes, I understand. So, here, all the development, everything you have to handle yourself. What would be provided here is exactly the same kind of thing, and your branding and everything will be there, but you will have no upfront cost. I mean, according to your requirements, this thing will be focused on Umrah. Not just Umrah, I have packages. Yes, you have all packages here. But if a system comes that is completely focused on Umrah, and you can update and sell everything in your package. Here too, you can update and sell. But the focus will be Umrah. In that case, would you use a secondary service? And in this case, for example, it could be commission-based or a monthly fixed flat fee for pricing.\n[10:37] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: It will depend on the price and its usefulness. [10:48] Muhammad: I understand. And now, in many cases, you have B2C travel marketplaces like Booking.com, they source things from everywhere and sell them. So, if there was such a marketplace, would you be interested in uploading your Umrah packages and selling directly to customers? [11:00] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Actually, clients don't buy from marketplaces without talking to someone. I've made it available on that portal, but no one looks there. They directly call to inquire, to understand, to come and see. That's how it is. Yes. Our market hasn't really become educated enough yet to just look at a package and choose from there. This might work if you target that market. But for now, the possibility is low. Like other agencies? Other agencies might see this and give a quotation or communicate. One minute, I have a phone call. [11:51] Muhammad: The system would be like this: first of all, there will be a B2C marketplace, and when a customer buys, they will have two options. They can book directly through the website, or if they don't want to do that, they can call you. This B2C market will be a gateway for you to the customer. And in that case, there might be a fee structure for the customer, and since you're displaying directly and customers are talking based on that display, it could be an option. If such an option exists, and in that case, imagine it's like setting up a stall in a large B2C market. You display your profile, and then customer engagement comes in. Would you be interested in providing a flat fee for this?\n[12:51] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Now, it's difficult to say, actually. I think there are one or two like that already. [13:00] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: I'm not sure if they're actually working. [13:03] Muhammad: Okay, so you have some doubts. And for B2B, you were suggesting if you could share your idea a bit. [13:12] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Which one? [13:13] Muhammad: You were sharing a B2B idea. [13:18] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No, I was saying that packages would be ready, and B2C people, especially, would prefer to buy, rather than B2B. Excuse me, one minute, yes. [13:30] Muhammad: No problem, Inshallah. Okay, I understand, brother. Meaning, a gateway for B2B. Okay, now let's talk about customer management. So, how do you internally track the customers you manage from B2C or B2B or any other source? Do you use Excel? Do you use any tools, and what challenges do you face in this regard?\n[13:58] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No, we have some corporate clients. Corporate people call and do things. Sometimes we do marketing. Some leads come from marketing. We keep these in Excel. We have accounting software. We also keep corporate ones there. [14:13] Muhammad: Okay. [14:13] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: That's how we're doing it for now. [14:16] Muhammad: Is this process enough for you, or which one for you? [14:19] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: I'm also working on it. If it happens, this problem will be solved. I'm getting a CRM for communication, phone, and email. Yes. These correspondences will be there. So, I'm working on that too. If it works out, I hope this problem will be solved. [14:42] Muhammad: Brother, for example, doing CRM here, maintaining a website, these are quite tech-intensive tasks. And usually, when agencies get these done, they use consulting companies, and after it's done, if there's a change, they have to call them again. If you don't have your own bandwidth or team, and if you try to get it done by an issue team, it becomes a distraction for the business. Will you focus on tech or on your business?\n[15:23] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Right. [15:24] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Often, the market is updating, different trends are going on, and I can't keep up. [15:29] Muhammad: I understand. Exactly. It's like this: there's a dedicated company that solves your problem. They work collaboratively with you, and they support not just you but 10 other people in this industry in the same way, so that by addressing everyone's pain points, the product becomes very strong. They work according to this, and then they charge you just a nominal service fee to solve these problems. It's a monthly subscription-based and opt-in/opt-out basis. You can exit anytime with one month's notice. Do you think such a service would solve your problem better in this kind of situation?\n[16:20] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes, I was hoping for something like this initially. But since it wasn't available in the market, I had to do these things myself. [16:27] Muhammad: I see. Okay, we are actually working on this kind of problem. But our main challenge is, brother, for travel, the problem is that many people are going to Thailand. Many are going to Malaysia. Many are going to China. And maybe someone is going on a business trip. But someone might not adhere to the halal-haram matter. They might be going to party or for some illicit purpose. And in this case, sometimes when advertising, many inappropriate things come up. In that situation, how do you ensure halal compliance? Providing your own, I mean, an Islamic-centric businessman, how do you ensure that in this type of industry?\n[17:34] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Halal food, not halal, I mean travel. For example, someone comes to you. They want something where you understand their intention is not halal. They are going there to party, right? In that case, you might be providing travel service, but their trip is not a halal trip. So here, as a business owner, when you want to do ethical Islamic business, this liability comes to you. So how do you ensure that you are only liable for their actions and not accountable to Allah for it? This kind of agreement doesn't really work. Our system is not yet in place. And secondly, I have even told my team that if anyone requests us to arrange travel with an ill intention, if we understand it initially, we create an issue that prevents us from providing them the service. [18:50] Muhammad: I understand, I understand. Okay, Kamruzzaman bhai, if we expand this, if we want to work with your business in a partnership, where we work as your tech partner. And we will provide you with complete tech support. Here you will have a list of Hajj, Umrah, and also halal-friendly travel destinations. We will withdraw some destinations. For example, if someone wants to go to a club, a strip club, there won't be anything of that kind. But if someone wants to go on a business trip to Nepal or somewhere else where you understand the intention is at least not visibly [inaudible], we can entertain those kinds of things. Something like a B2B plus B2C CRM portal combined, you can think of it like Goan or Shear, but it's more focused on halal travel tourism, Umrah, etc. In this case, would you be interested in collaborating together?\n[19:58] Muhammad: Collaboration means that we will handle the complete tech aspect. You, as our prime customer, might join. After joining, you will definitely provide us with a somewhat lower subscription fee. At the same time, you will give us your insights and feedback, which will help us improve the system. Plus, you will help us reach out to other customers. Like-minded ones. [20:30] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Hmm, something like that can happen. [20:34] Muhammad: Just a rough idea you can give, I mean, whether you or anyone else would do this kind of collaboration or not.\n[20:41] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Collaboration is fine. In this matter, I have connections with many people, don't I? I'm trying to understand that for many, it's like a SaaS type of thing, right? [20:54] Muhammad: For SaaS solutions, many people have a problem, they think their client details might be exposed to someone else. [21:03] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Hmm. [21:04] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Can be. [21:07] Muhammad: Hmm. [21:09] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Can access. So, many times, people are not interested. So, it's not easy. I said it, I did it, I told myself, 'Okay,' but not everyone will take it like this. Everyone tries to have some individual control so that at least their prime base doesn't have the possibility of going into someone else's hands.\n[21:44] Muhammad: Okay, I've done some digging and discussed this a bit. There are a few ways here. The thing we've thought about doing is that we won't store any client data with us. Rather, what needs to be done is that each service provider will connect their system to their own cloud provider, like Google Drive or Box. What will happen then is that for the client, we'll only keep a code name or something encrypted, and the actual client details will remain in the system of those who are buying the service. Ultimately, the chance of data leakage from here is extremely low, almost nonexistent. Because we won't have any data at all. The data will be in your own Google Drive. When our system works, it will connect with your Google Drive and fetch the data to us. That's how it will work. It's similar to how we connect with Google Drive for GDPR. And still, the concern of trust remains, whether I will actually keep my promise or whether I will actually do my thing. To mitigate this, we can operate under a strong legal framework where we might sign an NDA. We will have laws. So, in this case, if you feel that there has been a breach of trust, and you have documented evidence, then you can legally hold that company liable. If this can be done, do you think they would be interested, or would a fear still remain?\n[23:38] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Right. No, listen, the thing is, those who have thought about this SaaS [solution] are the ones who are concerned. But those who have never considered SaaS, for many, this whole thing will be new. [24:00] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: But they won't even raise this question. The fact that this could be a question, this could be something, might not even occur to them. Did you understand what I mean? [24:12] Muhammad: Hmm, hmm, hmm, I understand. [24:14] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: So now, there will be different types of people in the market. People of different levels. So, this can create an issue, that's what I meant. [24:25] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, I understand. So, we got some insights on this. Now, let's move to the last part. This is about our hotels and services in Makkah. Previously, every agency used to have agents in Makkah who worked for multiple agencies. They would buy hotels, then cars, and then provide them to the agencies. Now, it has moved to a Nusuk-based system. So, brother, if I say today that I want to start a Hajj business, how do I process it now? Or for anyone, what is the current system for the Hajj business? How do you manage Umrah hotels and services with the updated Nusuk guidelines?\n[25:31] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes. One minute. Hello. How much for the Singapore embassy? [25:39] Muhammad: Yes, brother, what I was saying is, with the updated Nusuk guidelines, what is the system now for buying hotels or sourcing services from Makkah? [25:52] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes, visas cannot be issued now without Nusuk-enlisted hotels. [25:57] Muhammad: Okay. What's the process now? [25:59] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: We have agents there. In Makkah and Madinah, in both places. I confirm hotels through agents. I get visas through those agents. So, they communicate with the hotel and get my visa done.\n[26:24] Muhammad: Okay. So, it's mainly the agents who do it now, still? I mean, there are no hotels or anything [direct]? You just get the list from Nusuk of who you can buy from. [26:34] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: I tell the agent, \"Give me a hotel in Nusuk. My range is this, hmm.\" [26:42] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: My money amount, say 200, 250, 300 whatever. According to the passenger, at whatever rate they want to go. And for five-star, four-star, there's no question. All are [enlisted]. So, based on that, they confirm the hotel, and the visa is issued against that hotel. [27:01] Muhammad: I understand, I understand. So, how reliable are these agents actually?\n[27:07] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: I've been working with them for several years, so I have no issue with their reliability. [27:13] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: You could say they are my enlisted agents. [27:18] Muhammad: Okay, I understand. So, brother, how did you source these agents? How does anyone find them if I want to start a business now? Is it easy to find them, or do they have a portal or system? [27:32] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: There is no portal. They don't have any portal. They came to Bangladesh sometimes. There was a program called \"Saudi Roadshow.\" A very large team came there. Many of us got acquainted there. Then by working, gradually, our thing developed. And I also individually went to Saudi many times. I met many people there. My target was the hotels that my target audience prefers more or are closer, better according to my client base. I communicated with them individually and gradually built these relationships. This has been going on for about eight, nine, ten, eight, nine years of continuous work, and it has become something. [28:34] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, so brother, suppose someone from China wants to start a Hajj and Umrah business. In this case, if they have a need for a reliable source in Makkah and Madinah, where they can directly collect hotels and, as much as possible, avoid middleman layers to keep the margin low with the actual hotel cost for the pilgrim. What would be their way to do this? How can they do it? [29:21] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Whose perspective? [29:22] Muhammad: Could you please tell me again? Suppose I want to start an agency today, and my goal is to ensure that I buy hotels directly from the source and provide them to the pilgrims so that the cost for pilgrims is reduced. I want to start such a business, and in that case, I will definitely need some agencies because, as far as I know, initially, hotels sell as is, and then they sell room-wise. So, to buy rooms wholesale, where should a person go? What is the best way?\n[29:58] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No, you will communicate directly with the hotels. You might target some hotels. Communicate with those hotels, and every year, hotels offer rates for three months, six months, or one year. You can purchase by communicating with that hotel. [30:22] Muhammad: I see. And that's for a year. And if I want to buy room by room, the way you do, in that case, if you do it through the hotel's share company, the hotel knows who they sold to. [30:37] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes. [30:38] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Then the hotel doesn't have any issue. The management handles it. They will then tell you, \"Contact this company or give you their contact number.\" You communicate with them to confirm the hotel or whatever.\n[30:57] Muhammad: I understand. So, brother, have you built relationships with any agents this way? [31:01] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: These hotels, hotel to hotel, they change every year. I mean, today I'm working with someone, tomorrow it might be that they've left this hotel and gone to another hotel. [31:14] Muhammad: I understand. [31:15] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: They do change every year. Yes? Sometimes they stay. For example, Karom, Karom Golden, Silva, Karom Macchi, all the Karom branches. They take some hotels and leave others. So, if I stay in touch with them, they manage to find me some hotel or another.\n[31:41] Muhammad: Okay, so that company exists. [31:45] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: So this. [31:46] Muhammad: You, yes, if you work it out for three months, six months, or a bit, those who do it, or if you communicate with hotels, you can target some hotels. If you call them, they will tell you, \"Contact this person.\" This won't be much of an issue. But if you communicate with someone outside the company, then there's a possibility of falling into trouble. [32:15] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: They might take payment from you but not do the work properly. This has happened, it does happen. [32:21] Muhammad: I understand. So, the relationships you've built, did you have to build them by going to Saudi, visiting hotels, talking to their offices?\n[32:33] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No. How did you do this? [32:36] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: It's in many different ways. I mean, each company came in a different way. It's not like everything came through one generic process. It happens that I communicated directly with some. Then, when I started working, I might have heard about someone else who provides better service at a lower rate. This way, one by one. Like, everything wasn't available to me on the first day. [33:14] Muhammad: I understand. So, brother, if you have experience in this field, what if we have a portal where various travel agencies can open and share their packages? And we also help them with growth. In that case, suppose you, as a senior agency member, join that portal, and a junior agency, who potentially is your rival agency, comes to you and asks for consulting or help, saying, \"Brother, I'm working on this portal, and I want you to work as a consultant with me.\" And then you help them for a fee as a travel consultant, and this help will improve their business, but they could also become your rival. Would you or any agency owner be comfortable with this kind of dilemma?\n[34:16] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Owners would not be comfortable. [34:19] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Okay, their staff. [34:23] Muhammad: Hmm. [34:24] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Staff often want to leave a job and go to another agency. [34:30] Muhammad: Hmm. [34:31] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: There are conditions like, \"You cannot go to this agency from my company, you do your own work, or you cannot enter this agency, you cannot join.\" Then it becomes a case. Understand? I mean, with rivals, it's like that. [34:57] Muhammad: Okay. And in that case, if someone thinks of starting an Umrah business anew, and they have no network, then a big challenge for them is exploring this market, building connections from this market. How can they do it? [35:10] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Actually, what you are trying is fine. What I did, let me tell you initially, when I started my new travel agency, I hired someone to target my market. Like, to do Umrah, I hired a guy who worked in that company.\n[35:45] Muhammad: Okay. [35:46] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: A senior guy who knows a lot internally. So, for that, I didn't have to go to the owner. Since I was new, I wasn't among the owners. It was easy for me. Yes, what I had to do was pay him a good salary. I had to pay a good initial payment. That's it. Other than that, there wasn't much issue. [36:13] Muhammad: I understand, I understand. So, that makes sense, brother. So now, brother, if it's like this, if we work on a big travel portal, and it's unconventional. But if it's like this, if we want you to be a senior member in Bangladesh, to be our consultant here, and in that case, you will definitely be remunerated on an hourly basis or a consultant basis. But as a product, it would be like this: the information available would be democratized in the market so that everyone can benefit and everyone who wants to do this business honestly can do it. Because ultimately, it's seen that in many cases, these secrets don't remain secrets because people find them out one way or another. But if it can be given as a service from which people can benefit. This can be a good source of revenue in many cases. Would you personally be comfortable working in this kind of capacity? [37:25] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: I, I, yes, okay, this is fine. As a consultant, I, I, no problem. I am interested. I have no problem being part of a new marketplace. But those in Bangladesh who work with Hajj and Umrah, they have separate licenses. One has to get them. Not anyone can do Hajj and Umrah. Secondly, their source, the source of customers, they are not tech-based, understand? So, their source is all the Khatibs and Imams in Bangladesh. An Imam in my area will be trusted more than this agency will be trusted by me.\n[38:15] Muhammad: Yes. [38:16] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes. So, an Imam usually has 20, 50, 100 customers, meaning Umrah or Hajj pilgrims. [38:29] Muhammad: You mean group leaders, as we call them? [38:31] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Group leaders. Yes. So, what do they do? Let me give you an idea. You probably know, but I'll tell you. [38:38] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: He prepares a group of 20, 50 people. 5 lakh, 7 lakh, 8 lakh, whatever they can get at this rate. He then communicates with 10 agencies. \"How much will you give?\" One says 4.5 lakh, another says 5 lakh 20, another says 5 lakh, another 4.5 lakh. The one that's cheaper, he goes with them and profits from the difference in between. Understand? So, that's one thing. There are others who are a bit educated, they also do things. You, you can do this. In that case, you'll have to deal only with those who have Umrah licenses and Hajj licenses.\n[39:40] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, brother, regarding what you're saying about competition, can't we sell the B2B platform you mentioned to group leaders in the same way? For example, there's a B2B platform where everyone uploads their Hajj packages, and then group leaders log in and see, \"Okay, Travel Trick BD is giving 5 lakh BDT per pilgrim for Hajj, and 1 lakh BDT for Umrah. For example, another agency like Makka Madina is giving 3 lakh BDT.\" They see all the prices and then bid or price from there. Can't such a system be made? Brother, have you heard of a company in Pakistan working on an ID called \"Funadiq\"? They work exactly like this. Would such a model work in Bangladesh? What's the problem in Bangladesh? There's a big gap between words and actions.\n[40:53] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes, yes. And if I tell you the truth, no one will believe me. But whatever that Hujur (religious leader) says, even if it's wrong, they will believe it. [41:04] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: And there are some bad people. There are some bad people. Let me tell you something: a few days ago, last year or the year before, some people did this during Umrah, towards the end of Umrah. They took a huge group during the last 10 days. [41:19] Muhammad: Hmm. [41:20] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: A huge group. They kept them there and made them perform Hajj and brought them back, saying, \"We are taking you for Hajj.\" When is Hajj time? It's not in Ramadan. [41:35] Muhammad: No, it's two and a half months later. [41:37] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Two and a half months later. So, he's taking them during Ramadan. The whole group. When they go to Ramadan, he will make them perform Umrah. Okay. What does he do after Umrah? He rents a house. When the Hajj preparations, I mean, activities begin, he takes them from that house, makes them perform the main Hajj, and then brings them back. He charges them 4.5 lakh BDT, but his cost was only 3 lakh BDT.\n[42:25] Muhammad: Hmm. [42:26] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Do you understand the matter? [42:30] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Some categories of people have this target. And big companies, the ones we call very big agencies, if they do number two [fraudulent acts], that's even more dangerous. They also rent houses. After renting a house, they'll get visas by showing a hotel on Nusuk. Yes, they'll make a contract with the hotel, understand? [43:03] Muhammad: They won't keep them in that hotel, but the visa is done. They'll bring them and might keep them in a hotel, but it won't be a Nusuk-approved hotel. [43:10] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: They understood. They will get a much lower rate at another hotel. Okay. [43:15] Muhammad: Okay. So, that means here they saved a lot of money on hotels.\n[43:24] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Hmm. [43:24] Muhammad: So, they booked for two days to get the visa, or for their 15-day trip, they kept them in another hotel and saved money, right? [43:32] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Right. And then your air ticket. What do they do with air tickets? For example, many airlines have 'with food' and 'without food' options. [43:42] Muhammad: Hmm. [43:43] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: I'm sharing what I've learned from experience. [43:49] Muhammad: This should actually be off the record. [43:52] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes, definitely, no problem, Inshallah. [43:58] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: One minute. Hello. Where? And via Madinah. And how much there? Okay, you separate the two. Okay, what were we doing? This won't be shared publicly. You can say it's only for our internal use.\n[44:31] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Some [tickets] are without meals. They couldn't include meals. What they do is, where there would be more money spent on meals, they give a packet from Dhaka when leaving, which you can eat on board. [44:48] Muhammad: Hmm. [44:49] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: And when returning, they cook or prepare meals there, pack them, and give them at the airport to eat at the airport or onboard, understand? This way, they reduce costs. These things they share with you. These are internal matters. You won't understand these troubles unless you know the whole tour. So, they do these things. They do these things to keep costs very low. You won't be able to provide it at that price, how can you? [45:25] Muhammad: I understand. But people don't know. They don't go for Umrah or Hajj multiple times, do they? And most of the time, those who are going from rural areas.\n[45:40] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Hmm. [45:41] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Not just from Dhaka, but from all over Bangladesh. Those from rural areas, for many, it's their first time in Dhaka, first time at an airport, first time on a flight. They have no idea about flight rules, whether meals are included, or if water is provided. Understand? It's difficult to judge whether it's good or bad from their perspective. They'll just look at the money. And they've seen Saudi Makkah with their own eyes. That's what matters. How they went, how they came, what they got or didn't get, that's nothing. [46:40] Muhammad: And then they can be easily scammed, right?\n[46:44] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Right. That's what they do. [46:45] Muhammad: Okay, so now if we start with a target market who are this. [46:50] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Now, what I just said, these are not small agencies doing this. The enlisted agencies are doing this. [47:04] Muhammad: Hmm. Yes, and they show that they are sending many people every year. But this way, this is not tourism. This is a. [47:11] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Scam. [47:12] Muhammad: Meaning, a scam. Yes. But it's not providing any service. No responsibility. Just left them there. I mean, there's an issue of service, which you won't get management of. [47:25] Muhammad: I understand. No, I've heard this too, and in that case, what I've heard is often because of this.\n[47:33] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Here, there's a good scope for providing good service. No doubt. There's a huge vacuum. If you can provide good service, you can do well. But here, they have syndicated this. They are not allowing any new agencies to get enlisted since 2015. No new agencies have been enlisted until 2025. Do you understand? They have syndicated it so that no one else can enter. They are playing this game in their own way. [48:19] Muhammad: I understand. No, this is a challenge in Bangladesh, I know, and in this case, if it becomes like this, that's why an online portal should come and democratize these things. For example, I know many people from Bangladesh who now have international credit cards are buying packages directly from Booking.com or Agoda and going. And booking.com or Agoda.com don't have licenses [in Bangladesh for Umrah/Hajj]. In this case, what they have to face... Now, if we can solve this problem where the pilgrim can buy hotels as they wish, buy packages, buy flights as they wish, whether they buy with or without food is entirely their decision. And in this case, we can only provide the service of guiding them on Nusuk-approved hotels and getting their visa done. And after that, if they can manage the rest themselves, providing them with a guide service in Makkah or informing them. Then I think this task becomes easier. And in that case, if we use technology, any young person in a Bangladeshi village, those below 50, are now using Facebook, iTok, Instagram, YouTube. So, if there's a simple app that guides them in Bengali in their own way, like \"this is your hotel, this is your flight, do these things on the flight, don't do these things, you will get this, you won't get that,\" if transparent information is given beforehand, and in cases where human presence is essential, like receiving from the airport, then guiding them during Hajj or Umrah for Ziyarat, if these things can be done, do you think this problem will be solved?\n[50:33] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Yes, it won't happen overnight. It can be done gradually. [50:38] Muhammad: I understand. Okay, brother, I'll just ask one last question. We mainly worked on logistics. Now let's just talk about the spiritual aspect. For example, gaining Hajj and Umrah knowledge, training, staying focused during Hajj and Umrah, performing Tawaf correctly, performing Sa'i. Because if these are not done, I might get all the logistics and hotels, but the worship itself isn't complete. How challenging are these things for pilgrims, or can pilgrims manage these tasks fairly well?\n[51:30] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: No, it is definitely challenging. You yourself went, I was there too. You saw, last time it was better, they say. So it is definitely, definitely challenging, and if regular input can be given online, saying, \"Now you will do this, after this, this will happen. You have to do this.\" This can definitely be a solution. And if we can train them well before going, and conduct small trainings and then tests on them. [52:16] Muhammad: Yes. [52:17] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Quiz-type questions, to see if they have received it from the training. [52:23] Muhammad: Yes. [52:24] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: If this can be done regularly for everyone, I mean, for every pilgrim, several times before going, I think this problem can be solved. [52:33] Muhammad: Okay, Kamruzzaman bhai, that's all for today. Thank you very much. You've given a lot of time. May Allah grant you abundant blessings, and Inshallah, we are trying to do something, and I hope, Inshallah, we will have you with us when we start working.\n[52:54] Mohammad Kamruzzaman: Inshallah, Inshallah. [52:56] Muhammad: Okay. Thank you. All right, brother. Inshallah. Assalamu Alaikum."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: Assalamu Alaikum, S.S. Shamol Hakim. We will conduct a short interview with you, Inshallah. So, you have intended to go for Umrah within the next few months, Inshallah. Can you start by telling us about your travel experience and how confident you are traveling alone to new places?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Waalaikum Assalam. Regarding myself, I have traveled a lot. I have lived in the UK before and visited Portugal. I traveled with my wife for a few trips. But all the travels I have done were according to my own plans. I arranged everything myself, from hotels to transport. So, in that regard, I feel that if I plan alone, I can do it alone. But still, I feel that since those who have performed Umrah have personal experience, if I take a little help from them, my plan will be even better.\nMuhammad: Okay, you have traveled to many places. So, what things do you usually look for when traveling anywhere, and is the Umrah trip the same for you? Or are there some differences in the Umrah trip?\nEhteshamul Hakim: No, when traveling anywhere, the thing I look for is that when I go to a place or travel to a place, I don't want to suffer there. And mainly, I want to be comfortable and see what I came to see. Along with that, I want to enjoy the good food of that place's culture, and also complete seeing the things I came to see. I am not the type of traveler who wants to see 10 places in one day, but I would like to see two places properly. For Umrah, it's pretty much the same. Because the main purpose is to visit Medina and Mecca. To see the two most important places in Medina and Mecca thoroughly. To spend enough time in these two places. But at the same time, it's also important to me that the distance from where I stay to the mosque. If it's too close, the price increases. But if it's too far, it becomes difficult. So, a medium-range distance where I can have a good hotel experience plus the experience for the purpose I went there. I mean, so that I don't suffer regarding food or other things while trying to balance both.\nMuhammad: Okay, so to summarise, it means you are not looking for a very luxurious travel experience. Nor are you preferring a free travel package. You want a balanced travel package where, Inshallah, the package will be decent, comfortable, and within an affordable range, and the pricing... So, if we consider your emotional state, Umrah is a different kind of travel; it has a spiritual sense, and the main goal is an act of worship. Does this create any nervousness for you?\nEhteshamul Hakim: I just thought about going to that place. Everyone I've heard from who has been there tells me that one should go there. The reason I chose to go now is that I can currently travel to several other countries. But it occurred to me that since I have the affordability now, why shouldn't I go there first? This is a positive emotion for me. Nervousness or this feeling—it's a spiritual matter, but maybe, for example, if I see the House of Allah the day after tomorrow, I don't know if I can keep myself calm, or if I will be able to control myself. I didn't think about it much before. But now, as I'm answering you about this, I'm thinking about seeing the House of Allah tomorrow. Thinking about this makes my heart feel a certain nervousness, fear, or emotion. And one of the main reasons for going to Umrah is that my parents have wanted to perform Umrah for a long time. To accompany them. Also, since Allah has given me some savings, and I can travel to other countries, why shouldn't I go to that place first? Thinking about all these things, I decided to go for Umrah. Another thing is, many people are very devoted or feel very close to Allah. My situation is not like that. I'm not ashamed to say this, because I'm not very practicing, but maybe that feeling is working inside me. And I also heard that no one can see the House of Allah unless Allah wills it. So, if I feel that and if my life changes after coming back from there, I also want a change in my life. All these things combined are why I'm planning this.\nMuhammad: Inshallah, you are considering Umrah as a life-changing event that will bring you closer to Allah in a more positive way, right?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Well, I'm not yet thinking of it as a life-changing event, but I can only judge myself after going through an experience. Many of my friends and brothers recently returned from Umrah, and I know many people who returned to their old lifestyles after performing Umrah. I don't know what will happen to me. However, as a Muslim, it is everyone's dream to see that House, and since my parents want to see it, I want to fulfill that dream from all perspectives.\nMuhammad: I understand. Alright, a question about Hajj. Performing Hajj is an obligatory act of worship in Islam, and considering the cost and logistics, Hajj can be performed with a bit more effort than Umrah. So, why not Hajj? Why start with Umrah? What was your philosophy here?\nEhteshamul Hakim: My philosophy here is that Hajj is a very big event for everyone. Umrah is also a big event. Hajj is a really big event. Many people say from an Islamic perspective that all previous sins are forgiven after performing Hajj if the Hajj is accepted. In that case, obviously, if I had that much money or financial backup, or even more backup, then maybe I would consider going for Hajj. Now, another big thing is mentally, what I think is that after my daughter was born, if I ever perform Hajj, I will do it with my daughter or with my family. I cannot accept the idea of going for Hajj without my daughter or my wife. And yes, it's a good question why I am not performing Hajj now. If I get an answer in the back of my mind, then I'm not ready.\nMuhammad: Okay, so when you say \"ready,\" do you mean more spiritually or financially?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Spiritually, I believe that performing Hajj requires a certain worthiness from a person. Whether a person is worthy of Hajj or not also matters. If I don't pray my daily prayers, or if I don't try to pray as much as I should, and then I just go for Hajj to Allah, and Allah accepts my Hajj, it doesn't seem that easy to me.\nMuhammad: Okay, okay. So, if you think about Umrah now, Umrah has two parts: one is the logistical part, like air tickets, transportation, hotels, visiting places, staying healthy—these are the ancillary aspects of worship. And the worship itself, is there anything about it that seems troubling, worrying, or confusing to you, or something that you are afraid of? Or are you pretty confident about it, Inshallah?\nEhteshamul Hakim: It's not fear, but rather an inquiry I have about travel. Firstly, regarding the destination, there are two ways to go: one can go from Medina to Mecca, or from Mecca to Medina. Obviously, the first thought for anyone is where they will stay first. This is a big part of well-being and logistical support. To have well-being, you must stay in a soothing place from where you will operate. So, the thought remains in the back of my mind: will the place I select be perfect for my family, for my elderly parents? \"Perfectness\" means different things to different people; some say a five-minute walk to the mosque is perfect, but in that case, the cost increases. For me, walking 5 to 10 minutes is not a big deal. Another thing that concerns me is if I stay at a hotel 15-20 minutes or half an hour away, does that hotel have a good shuttle system? Some hotels offer continuous bus transport. Those things are a bit troublesome for me. I worry if I will find such a hotel that provides these services so I can get there quickly. Another thing that concerns me is in case of an emergency. Since many elderly people will be going, if there's a medical emergency, who will I contact?\nEhteshamul Hakim: This is a matter of thinking. And mainly, besides accommodation, there's the matter of worship. Yes, obviously, since I haven't done Umrah or Hajj before, even if we educate ourselves, it would be much better if there was guidance or a complete roadmap for the worship, which I don't know yet. This is something that bothers me.\nMuhammad: Okay, so let me ask you something here: you've been to the UK and traveled to other places. But Saudi Arabian culture is a bit different. For example, you might have seen that the culture of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan is not similar to Western countries. And similarly, African culture is also different. The Middle Eastern Umrah culture is completely different. So, how confident are you that if you go for a self-guided Umrah, specifically, you can manage logistics, flights, hotels, visas, and transport yourself? Even though it's different, countless tourists go there every year. Muslims from all over the world travel there throughout the year. So, what I've seen is that if a city always has travelers coming and going, they become traveler-friendly. And they can understand English speaking or other things. Because I don't think the situation in the Middle East or Saudi Arabia will be very different from this. However, if it is different, in that case, I am not too worried that it will be very different or that I will have many problems. But one thing is that when you travel, it's not just about booking flight tickets and hotels yourself. If there is a travel agent of this type who provides everything, then there's a security in talking to the travel agent if any problem arises, which I might not get if I go alone.\nMuhammad: Okay, so if I ask, the cost of doing it yourself might be almost similar to going through a travel agent. If so, why aren't you going with a travel agent? I mean, your point is, I want to do it myself, but I want to do it through a travel agent. But my point is, I will provide the total plan. Many times, when people ask a travel agent, \"I want to go on this day, make a plan for me,\" my approach is the opposite. I make the plan. After making it, I state my requirements. I will first go to Medina. I will stay in this type of hotel in Medina. After staying there, they must provide this service. Then I will go to Mecca. I will stay in Mecca for three days. Then I will return via Jeddah. And my hotel requirement is a hotel between 10,000 to 12,000 Taka, close would be good. I verify these requirements myself—how much my plane fare will be, how much it will cost if I book hotels on Booking.com. After verifying this, I tell it to the travel agent. When the travel agent gives me a price, if I see that they are not asking too much, then of course they will make some profit; it's their business. But if I see that they are asking too much—I have been to many countries and seen travel agents where it costs 1 lakh Taka, but one travel agent asked me for 1 lakh 5 thousand Taka, and another travel agent asked for 1 lakh 30 thousand Taka, for the same plan. So, there, I can judge who I will choose and who I will not. So, when I travel, I don't just contact one travel agent. I contact three or four travel agents. Finally, if I see that a travel agent seems honest to me or aligns with my plan, then I choose them.\nMuhammad: Okay, I understand. Now, let me ask you a question: Suppose you book the travels yourself, provided you have an international credit card. You book hotels, transportation, and Haramain yourself through online travel agents like Booking.com or Agoda.com, and you get a price. And then you see that a travel agent who arranges everything for you charges a bit more. In that case, what kind of margin is tolerable for you from a travel agent?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Obviously, a person can do this entirely by sitting at a computer, but there is knowledge behind doing this.\nEhteshamul Hakim: Even though a person can do it on a computer, there is personal experience, specific knowledge, and intelligence being used. So, I think if a travel agent charges up to 100 thousand Taka as a per-consultation fee for an Umrah package, it's not too much for them. 100 thousand, [inaudible] 5 thousand, it's too little. If they charge 100 thousand for this fee and on that basis, they book everything for me, arrange my car, and the car driver as well—for example, if I go from here to Taif.\nEhteshamul Hakim: When going to Taif, I would need to arrange a separate car. Arranging this car would be a hassle. So, if that car is also arranged within my travel plan, and the travel agent has contact with the car driver, instructing them to pick up here, do this and that today—if a travel agent takes on this hassle and arranges everything to create a travel plan for me, then is the money for one person?\nMuhammad: If I travel, I will travel as a couple.\nEhteshamul Hakim: I am not talking about a group. If I consider a couple or a group of three people, then for a group of three people, yes, but if you consider a group of 20 people, or if you exclude a couple and consider 10 or 4 people, then the fee might increase. But I believe for a couple's fee or for a small number of people, like a family, since they don't need to check three, four, or five extra cars, in that case, I think roughly four to five thousand Taka per traveler is a fair amount. You find that fair. You also mentioned that there is a price disparity among travel agents, like you saw for the same package, similar to 1 lakh 5 thousand and 1 lakh. For example, let me tell you about the package. I contacted Mr. Tour & Travels, a very famous travel agency in Bangladesh that offers Hajj packages. I told them the dates: I would go on October 6th and return on October 12th. I told them all my requirements, starting with going to Medina first. After going to Medina, everything I said. So, after I told them everything, they told me it would cost 1 lakh Taka per person.\nEhteshamul Hakim: Per person. When I dug into this myself, excluding transportation fees from Medina to Mecca and Mecca to Jeddah, my maximum cost would be 41 [thousand] per person. If I consider it per person, my cost would be around 41 [thousand], so their amount is almost 300-400 Taka more.\nMuhammad: Okay, if I consider a four-star hotel, which I assume is around 14 or 15 thousand Taka.\nEhteshamul Hakim: In that case, I felt they quoted me a very fair amount.\nMuhammad: So, did you verify one agency?\nEhteshamul Hakim: I mean, I have already inquired with one agency, and I am in contact with another agency, and I will contact two more agencies.\nMuhammad: Okay, now, many people in Bangladesh are worried about travel agencies. What do you think about this? Do you think travel agencies will maintain the promises they make, or do you think in some cases, travel agents might over-promise? Do you have this worry?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Travel agents in Bangladesh over-promise on a few things. Here, I'd like to say that there are many groups on Facebook, you'll see advertisements like \"1.5 lakh Taka package,\" \"1 lakh Taka Umrah package.\" Many people get tempted by things like \"1.5 lakh Taka to Thailand,\" \"1 lakh Taka to Thailand,\" \"1 lakh Taka to Sri Lanka Maldives.\" When I went to Sri Lanka, my experience was very good, I toured beautifully. At that time, I met a group who had gone on a Sri Lanka-Maldives dual package for 75 thousand Taka. Their experience was that when they arrived in Sri Lanka, they couldn't sleep in the hotel. At one point, they said they wouldn't stay in that hotel and would go to another. Many people don't know the price difference even within three-star hotels, and the price difference between three-star and four-star isn't that much. But the hassle of staying there, many people don't know. And many travel agents exploit this loophole. They talk about three-star hotels or use such sweet-sounding words to attract people, but they cannot deliver on that. The same goes for drivers. They also arranged a driver through the travel agency, but the car broke down halfway.\nMuhammad: Hmm.\nEhteshamul Hakim: The car broke down halfway, and it took so long for another car to arrive that their entire travel plan was ruined. So, many travel agents don't maintain these things properly, they don't keep backup plans. And most importantly, look brother, people who are traveling, who are going abroad for Umrah, they are not poor. They are looking for a beautiful experience. Now, if someone says, \"I will do it for one lakh Taka,\" and they do it for one lakh Taka, but the experience isn't good, that person will curse them. But if someone charges 10,000-20,000 Taka more and makes the experience beautiful, then people will always remember that travel agent's name. So, I think the experience is very important here, and seven out of ten agencies in Bangladesh don't provide that.\nMuhammad: Meaning, they don't provide a proper experience.\nEhteshamul Hakim: No.\nMuhammad: Okay, so when you choose a travel agent, you haven't been before. All agents do attractive marketing. So, what are your criteria here? For example, if two travel agents approach you, how would you justify which travel agent you will go with? What criteria would you look at to justify?\nEhteshamul Hakim: First, when two travel agents tell me their plans, after the plan, I will ask them everything: what hotel will you provide for accommodation? What hotel will I stay in to do this? What driver will you provide from where I go? What kind of car will it be? I specifically ask about these things.\nEhteshamul Hakim: That when I land in Medina, and I go to Mecca from Medina, what kind of car will I be using? I understand it's a car, but what specific car?\nMuhammad: What's the car model? When I know all this from both of them, then I will feel that the hotel—if a person names a hotel, they can see the hotel on YouTube, how its breakfast is, or generally on Google or elsewhere. Nowadays, if you search for a hotel name on YouTube, you can see everything from its interior to breakfast. When you see both, and you feel which one is more convenient among the two options, then I choose that way.\nMuhammad: Okay, so what you do is, you actually take the full travel details from them, and then you manage that.\nEhteshamul Hakim: I provide the details.\nEhteshamul Hakim: I provide the details first. I say, \"I will go here, I will go there, give me this kind of hotel.\" Now, they have many interlinks with hotels. So, if I say a four-star hotel, and they have 10 hotels under that category, they will tell me about two hotels. Another agency might also tell me about two hotels. Apart from the accommodation, they also fix the rest of the plan, like \"I will go at this time, I will do this at that time.\" Most travel agents organize the daily schedule in a way that feels convenient for me.\nMuhammad: Okay, so when you go, it's important for you to manually verify how important and how much the services they are providing are.\nEhteshamul Hakim: Last time, when I went to Thailand completely through a travel agent, they gave me a format and asked me, \"Sir, please confirm.\" This confirmation thing changed a total of eight times. After the travel agent, I confirmed after that thing changed eight times.\nEhteshamul Hakim: This is about ShareTrip and general travel experience. I have traveled and my experience was very good, but I made many changes. So, I think if it's a travel agent, the most, most, most important thing is the person who is dealing with this, the person who is dealing with the customer, the person who is making these plans and talking to the customer. When talking to the customer or dealing with them, they must understand what type of customer it is. Some customers just say, \"Oh, you couldn't do it cheaper?\" or say this and that; there's no point wasting time with them. But for a sensitive customer who is authentically going for this, the person providing the service must understand and grasp the situation from the very beginning.\nMuhammad: Okay, so if we consider an alternative approach, technology has advanced a lot now. What if, instead of talking directly to a human being, you talk to an AI chatbot, and it shows you curated travel packages according to your preference? Right? And based on that, you research and find that it's good. You work from home. But you understand it's not a human; you're talking to an AI that's just bringing data from an interface system to show you. Would that be comfortable for you, or would you prefer talking to a human?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Actually, we are not yet used to AI. Also, human emotion or human [interaction]... I have some doubt whether AI can catch that sometimes. However, in many cases, I have seen AI providing better service than humans. So, if I get a plan from AI, and I study that plan, then I will be able to say whether human is better or AI has planned it better for me.\nMuhammad: So, you are open to the AI option?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Of course, I am.\nMuhammad: Okay, that makes sense. Overall, your main concern is a reliable travel agency that will have a detailed, transparent discussion with you, and after that, you will try to verify things yourself. Now, for the last question regarding logistics: suppose a travel agent tells you all the details. What percentage of trust do you have that a Bangladeshi travel agent will deliver 100% of what they promise? And if you don't have that much trust, what percentage do you expect them to deliver?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Frankly speaking, when people choose travel agents in Bangladesh, currently, they don't choose without a travel agent.\nEhteshamul Hakim: In Bangladesh, there are a few travel agents who, in my opinion, provide good service and are patient, who highly value customer reviews, highly appreciate everything. Among them, ShareTrip and GoZ (GoZ is especially good) – I feel they are trustworthy, not like they will take money and not deliver. There are many local travel agents as well. So, in Bangladesh, I don't think people rely on more than seven to ten travel agents.\nMuhammad: Okay, but as far as I know, ShareTrip and GoZ don't typically do Umrah packages.\nEhteshamul Hakim: They do Hajj and Umrah packages.\nMuhammad: When you go to an unknown travel agent, how do you decide if this travel agent is trustworthy and will keep their promises? What would be the deciding factor for you?\nEhteshamul Hakim: One of the biggest deciding factors is how they are marketing. I will check their Facebook. I will check how many viewers they have on Facebook. I will check their reviews on Facebook. I will search on YouTube to see if there are videos from people who have traveled through them before. I will check if those who went are satisfied with that. Nowadays, there are blogs for everything. Umrah blogs, Hajj blogs, many types of blogs. Now, if you search on YouTube, like \"that blog by SS Tal\"\nEhteshamul Hakim: \"that blog by ShareTrip\" or \"that blog\" something like that. If you search for that, you will find it. Then, if I see that the visuals plus the reviews match, then I will go with them.\nMuhammad: Okay, alright. So, these were mainly the questions about logistics. What's clear is that you have a good understanding of travel agents and how to vet them, but you still have a fear about hotels, as you're not yet sure what distance would be best. And since you're taking elderly people, health is important to you. Here's something I want to share: you are a doctor, but still, health is a concern for you.\nEhteshamul Hakim: After I go, I won't be able to operate as I usually do.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's move on to spiritual matters. You mentioned that you still don't know how to perform it. But your main goal here is to perform an act of worship. How are you planning to prepare yourself for this worship? What is your plan here?\nEhteshamul Hakim: My plan here is, first, if I get the visa. Since there are still two months left, if I get the visa and book everything, then I will be mentally ready, without a doubt, that I am going. At that time, I will approach my brothers and friends who have performed Umrah before. I will ask them how to prepare, what I can do, or if my Arabic is weak, will my Umrah still be accepted? With all this knowledge and time, since there are still two or three months, or about three months, I will start preparing myself for it at least two months in advance.\nMuhammad: I understand. So, Umrah is a form of worship that is not like prayer, where you have to be completely disconnected. During Umrah, you can look at books, move around, and talk. In that case, is it important to you that you learn and know everything so thoroughly that you don't need any books or learning resources? Or would you consider using a book or?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Definitely a book.\nEhteshamul Hakim: Since there's no compulsion for this, and I'm not that [practicing], if there is a book that clearly explains what to do and what to see, that would be good. Another thing is, I don't think I can say this now, but not everyone knows Arabic. For example, I used to learn the Quran, I even completed reciting it, but I have forgotten Arabic.\nEhteshamul Hakim: So, that thing bothers me: if I've forgotten Arabic, will my prayers be valid, or will my Umrah be valid? So, I think it's important to remove that fear from people's minds, and if the basic things are all beautifully organized in a book—like what you need, what to master, what to do—then the task becomes much easier.\nMuhammad: Okay, I understand. So, everyone has mobile devices now. Do you think a mobile app can replace a book, or would a mobile [app] be more distracting for you?\nEhteshamul Hakim: A mobile can actually replace it, but you have to look at this a bit differently. When you are performing Umrah, you have a mobile in your hand, and you are looking at it and doing something – that might not look good. And then, a notification might pop up. For example, a sudden notification or a call from home could distract you. So, I think having a book in hand at that time is good. But also, since people are used to mobiles, a mobile can always be used. The advantage of using a mobile is that when people are at home or other places and they practice, their mobile is with them. Then it becomes useful because they don't have to suddenly pick up a book for their daily practice. But then, for example, when you are inside the mosque, and you take out your mobile, even if you are doing something good, like making supplications, people around might suddenly look and say, \"Why are you using your mobile inside the mosque?\" So, this distraction, I think, can exist. But I think both options are good.\nMuhammad: Okay, so a mobile is personally okay for you, but your worry is that it might create cultural inappropriateness.\nEhteshamul Hakim: Because many Bengalis, especially, might look at you if you're inside the mosque, using your mobile, even if you're doing something good, like making supplications. They might suddenly look and say, \"Why are you using your mobile inside the mosque?\" So, these are the things.\nMuhammad: Okay, in this case, do you think having a live guide, instead of a mobile or a book, who would essentially guide you through the Umrah, would add value for you, and would you be willing to pay extra for this?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Absolutely, this would add a lot of value. If there's a live guide who, for example, when I go to Mecca or Medina, or wake up, I go to the hotel, and my guide comes and asks, \"How are you? Are you well? Okay, tomorrow morning we will go to the mosque at this time, and we will do this.\" Then it becomes like a live navigation for me. And the same goes for Mecca. When I go for Umrah in Mecca, if he comes and tells me, \"Today morning we will go here, in the afternoon we will go there. The rest of the time you can roam around.\" Then my task becomes much easier. And since he is experienced in doing it there repeatedly, it definitely makes my task easier, and he certainly deserves a charge for that.\nMuhammad: Okay, in that case, a live guide would do this work. Now, with your experience, as you said, you've traveled to various places. What if, instead of a live guide, there was a live AI that, for example, used maps or AI prompts to provide you information, answer all your questions, and help you, and you could avail it at a fraction of the cost, and it's available on demand for you? Would you explore this, or do you think a live guide cannot really be replaced by an AI or a mobile app?\nEhteshamul Hakim: This is something that an AI can definitely do. Why not? AI can do it. But the live experience is different. For example, if I go to a calendar task and set it up, saying \"I will wake up at 8 o'clock, go here at 10 o'clock, go there, go to this place.\" My phone will give me an alarm saying, \"Now it's time to go here,\" within the task. But it's not the same as having a live guide with me when I go there. I don't think AI would be more efficient in that sense.\nMuhammad: Okay, so if there's a live guide, the urgency and...\nEhteshamul Hakim: Urgency and human-to-human interaction.\nMuhammad: And the organization, you really value that. Okay, okay, that makes sense. Alright, so with the things you're doing now, are they running smoothly, or do you feel there are too many choices, or a lack of clarity, or are you overloaded with decisions? Is there anything like that?\nEhteshamul Hakim: No, not yet. I'm not overloaded with anything right now. For example, I'm planning when to get the visa. Since I planned everything a long time ago, step by step after getting the Umrah visa, I am not overwhelmed yet.\nMuhammad: Okay, last question then, let's finish. Currently, there are many limitations and processes for going for Umrah from Bangladesh. But if you were told about an ideal scenario for performing Umrah, what would your ideal Umrah journey be like? I mean, if you were told you could wish for anything, what would your wish be in that case?\nEhteshamul Hakim: When I say an ideal scenario, I mean that when a person travels from one place to another, they should travel without any hindrance. There's not much more a traveler needs from here. I'll board the plane. After boarding, there will be good service or a good seat or good management. I'll just land there. My immigration will be smooth there. Apart from that, the experience after arriving is different. So, other than that, I don't think there's much else. However, the immigration problems that occur from Bangladesh, the specification problems—I think if these things are smooth and soothing, then a traveler should have no other concerns.\nMuhammad: So, you're saying an uneventful, simple, no-hassle travel is what you wish for. Thank you for your time. These were our questions. We just need permission; since we did this for research, we believe those currently performing Hajj and Umrah or working in the industry can benefit greatly from it. Can we share it with them?\nEhteshamul Hakim: Yes, of course.\nMuhammad: Alright, Inshallah. Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.\nEhteshamul Hakim: Assalam."

    "english_transcript": "Muhammad: Please just formally introduce yourself and mention which year you performed Hajj, and share your Hajj experience.\nFarhadul: Okay. Assalamu Alaikum. My name is Mohammad Farhad Alam Khan. I joined Hajj from Bangladesh in 2024. I am joining this meeting to share my overall Hajj experience. Is that okay?\nMuhammad: So, let's start with the pre-Hajj preparation. It's very important to prepare before Hajj. There's a logistical preparation, and then there's the religious and spiritual preparation. You have to take that preparation because Hajj is not an easy journey. So, how did you take this preparation, and how did you prepare yourself for it, and what challenges did you face in taking this preparation?\nFarhadul: Actually, since I went for Hajj through an agency, the agency provided us with all Hajj-related information through various meetings and groupings from time to time. Their Hajj experts or scholars briefed us on various aspects. Those of us who could attend physically, attended. Those who couldn't attend physically due to work or professional reasons, they sent us these after the meetings online, uploaded them on YouTube channels, and on their websites. And for those who were interested and had time, they provided direct joining options via Zoom meetings. And they also provided us with various books and documents through which we gained guidance on various activities, our duties, and how to perform an accepted Hajj.\nMuhammad: If it's like this, since you attended many things online or virtually, as you mentioned before that you were abroad, do you think an in-person program is really essential, or is it possible to completely prepare by watching YouTube videos or recorded videos, Insha'Allah?\nFarhadul: Completing the entire program by watching recorded videos is often not possible. Because many times, various questions arise. To solve these questions or to know the correct answers, joining real-time or physical activities and meetings, along with online participation, sometimes requires physical attendance. For example, if there are 10 seminars, I believe at least three or four should be attended physically. The rest can be covered online.\nMuhammad: Okay, so in that case, the main problem you mentioned is questions. We can address questions online. For instance, if there's a question during a video lecture, you could post it in a forum, or if it's a live stream, you could post it online, and if your questions are answered, would that solve this problem?\nFarhadul: In that case, if the organizers provide sufficient time for questions and answers, then yes. But if it's within a very limited time, then it becomes a bit difficult. Sometimes, those who are physically present also have questions, and a large number of participants online also need answers. So, it's a time-consuming matter. If the organizers arrange it that way, it's definitely good. They can also do it another way. For example, they can arrange some completely online-based sessions. In that case, those of us who are online participants can attend, and it might be beneficial.\nMuhammad: Since you went with a Dhaka-based agency, most Dhaka-based agencies can rent a good community hall or arrange proper training. But sometimes, people go through agencies that can't organize training, or even if they do, the training might not be up to standard. In such a case, what do you think? If someone goes with an agency that doesn't provide any training but fulfills 100% of the logistics. In that scenario, do you think the pilgrim should get training from another third-party source?\nFarhadul: Actually, it's very difficult to go for Hajj without training. From my real-life experience, throughout the entire duration of Hajj – because I was there for the full Hajj package as it's typically done from Bangladesh, I was there for the full duration – I observed many things. For example, those who came from various rural areas who didn't have proper training or any prior knowledge, in many cases, they didn't know the correct procedures for performing Hajj. And they made many mistakes, often unknowingly or based on their own assumptions, which are not conducive to a complete Hajj. In specific cases, they sometimes committed acts of Shirk (idolatry), because they didn't know how to do things. They were performing acts of worship incorrectly, and they weren't even aware of it. In many cases, they couldn't fully observe the rules of Hajj because they lacked that knowledge or weren't properly trained. In that regard, as far as I've seen, only those who came through good Hajj agencies from Dhaka and Chittagong (being the capital cities), who were properly guided or trained by scholars, among them I only saw accuracy in Hajj performance. But in the case of the millions of pilgrims, nearly a hundred thousand pilgrims went from Bangladesh, and it seems to me that the majority of them had a lot of ignorance, and there's some doubt whether their Hajj was fully complete if they performed it that way.\nMuhammad: In this regard, it often happens that those who bring pilgrims from rural areas in Bangladesh often serve the logistical purpose for training. In that case, what if pilgrims take training from a third party and then perform Hajj? For instance, suppose you performed Hajj with Shepherds (agency). What if someone goes for Hajj with another agency but only takes training from Shepherds? If such a service were introduced, do you think it would add value?\nFarhadul: This, this is definitely [beneficial] because Hajj has two parts: one is logistics, and the other is performing Hajj. Performing Hajj is the complete purpose of going. And logistics means I need to have a place to stay, move around, eat, these things, in order to perform. That's a part of Hajj, but it's not a part of worship. Therefore, to complete the worship perfectly, in any way possible, it's essential to get training from a knowledgeable scholar who genuinely knows how to perform Hajj, what activities to do there, how to worship, and how to complete Hajj. Whether it's online, offline, or physical, it's important to be in their company. And sometimes it seems to me that this is not just pre-Hajj training. If something like this could be done where, during Hajj itself, if a situation arises or a question comes to mind, the pilgrim can instantly get the answer directly through Messenger, a direct link, or any technology or IT app or other means. In that case, it would be very good. Because in Saudi Arabia, at least during Hajj time, we had constant access to IT and the internet. We could access anything anytime, in any situation. So, this is really appropriate and very helpful.\nMuhammad: Okay, in that case, let me tell you something since you mentioned accessing the internet. Regarding this, I want to ask, usually when you go to Saudi Arabia, everyone buys a SIM card, but those who go especially later in their journey often face many hassles during travel. You might have seen that the journey is not always smooth. And after that, there's the issue of doing Umrah right after arrival. So, do you think it would add value for people if SIM package sellers or those who sell eSIMs offered a travel package for two or three days until arrival in Saudi Arabia, which could then be extended later? Or [is it better to buy SIM] in Saudi Arabia?\nFarhadul: No, it will definitely add value if the price is comparatively affordable, then it will definitely add value. Because most agencies, our agency and others, had already warned us beforehand not to hastily buy a SIM card from the airport. They advised us to buy a SIM card after arriving and understanding the options. Since a person cannot register more than two SIM cards during the full duration of their stay. So, we were repeatedly told to go and buy a SIM card wisely, not in a hurry. Because getting a SIM card immediately upon arrival can be difficult in many cases. After arriving, and after Umrah and everything, if one or two days of support can be provided from back home at a reasonable price, then the person can then understand what package would be good for them, how long they will stay, how much internet they need, and select their preferred package accordingly.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, so in that case, what happens is, in Saudi Arabia, we usually bought SIM cards for a month, which was around 50 riyals at most. But it was a bit of a hassle initially. So, if someone takes a three-day package from the time they leave for Hajj until they arrive, how much do you think would be an affordable and fair price for that three-day package, if I were to say in US dollars?\nFarhadul: No, now many people there, like us, bought for one month, and later when we had to extend for 10 days, we initially thought it was okay, around 60 riyals for a month, which is good, 2 riyals per day. But later, when we extended for 10 days, we had to spend a significant amount, which was actually quite a lot later. Since normally very few people stay for more than a month, most people go for a duration of around one month, and for Umrah, it's even shorter. In that case, if it's at least within 10 riyals for the first two or three days, then I think it would be good for people, they would afford it.\nMuhammad: Okay, 10 riyals means three to four dollars maximum, right?\nFarhadul: Yes, for the first two or three days, they can use it. Because many people go only for three days, a short visit just to perform Umrah and return. For them, if such a package is offered, I think it would be good. And if a week-long package is offered, that would be even better, around 20 riyals for a 10-day SIM package, that would be even better. This would be very comfortable for those who primarily go for Umrah, the pilgrims performing Umrah, and they wouldn't have to worry or face extra hassle about getting another SIM or getting into a network.\nMuhammad: Okay, I understand. So now let's talk about the courses. Where you went with Shepherds, the course pricing was included in your package pricing, and as far as we know, agencies spend a good amount to properly train pilgrims. Now, if someone takes a slightly more reasonable package where training is not included, and then to compensate for that, they buy an online course, or perhaps they couldn't attend the training due to being busy. In that case, if someone wants to buy an online course, what would be the maximum fair price for the entire Hajj course, plus 24/7 support for any questions and answers during Hajj?\nFarhadul: Actually, it's relative. It's relative because, for example, packages in Bangladesh usually range from 6 lakh to 10-12 lakh, or 10 to 11 lakh. Now, the mentality of those who afford packages within 6 to 7 lakh BDT and those who afford packages within 10 to 12 lakh BDT are not the same. For instance, those who spend 6 to 7 lakh BDT will also want the training course to be a bit cheaper or more affordable along with the Hajj package. Whereas those who spend 10 to 12 lakh BDT will think that money is not a big factor here; their time and materials are important. So, overall, what kind will it be? Will it be online-based, or online with offline or physical?\nMuhammad: Completely if online, completely if online...\nFarhadul: Actually, regarding the material or online classes or courses, I don't think I have that kind of idea. But it should definitely be within 10-12 thousand Taka, roughly 10 to 15 thousand, it really depends on the material and what kind of scholar or how it's done. Because here, face value is a big factor. If it's done through a normal scholar, there's one kind of face value. If it's done through a renowned scholar of the country, there's another kind of face value. So, considering that, I think it would be good if it's within 10 to 15 thousand Taka, if it's a good scholar who people know and respect, whose fatwas or rules they trust.\nMuhammad: And if it's like this: a renowned scholar guides you through online videos, but when it comes to questions and answers, you can't talk to that renowned scholar. Instead, you talk to someone who is studying or has graduated from the University of Madinah or a good Islamic university. Because Hajj is a basic act of worship in Islam, and generally, students of knowledge have a good understanding of it. In that case, would that be acceptable to you, or would you prefer that your questions and answers are handled by a major scholar?\nFarhadul: Now, actually, it's a personal matter. Personally, many times, as I said before, face value is a very big thing in many cases. If I talk about medicine, if I talk about a patient, for example, if a patient goes to a doctor who has completed postgraduate studies, that doctor will give the same medicine for a fever. But if that patient goes to a head of department, a very big professor, they will also give the same medicine. But a normal postgraduate doctor might charge 500 Taka, while a big professor charges 1000 Taka. Here, there's no difference in the medicine; it's the face value. The situation here is similar because for the main activities of Hajj and everything, it's not actually necessary to have a very big or highly prominent scholar. Now, it actually depends on how much faith one has in someone, and people's experience will depend on their faith. Now, if a good person, for example, someone who has graduated or done their Master's from Madinah University, or even in Bangladesh, good scholars who have studied from Islamic universities or various places, they can also provide proper guidance. They also have sufficient knowledge of how to perform Hajj 100% correctly. And for a very high-caliber scholar, because there are no fatwas here, nothing new to invent. It's about informing people how to perform Hajj purely, as our Prophet performed it. Even a moderately knowledgeable scholar knows this, because they won't judge anything or issue any fatwa. But in the end, when it comes to India [probably means \"in the end\" or \"ultimately\"], face value is a factor. When a very big scholar comes, it's naturally psychological for people to think, \"A very big scholar has come, of course, it will be expensive.\" And if an average scholar conducts the course, it will be of that kind. So, in that case, and a big scholar will not answer everything, because those who are with him, one person alone cannot do or conduct the entire course. So, for that reason, I think that under the supervision of a scholar, if others also answer and provide everything, that's fine. But if there are very specific, technical questions that are not possible for an average person to answer,\nFarhadul: Then that opinion should be taken from a scholar. Because during the entire duration of Hajj, many small questions arise. It makes one think, \"Is there any problem with my Hajj? Is there any issue with my Hajj?\" At that time, they want an opinion from a very good, expert, or very knowledgeable person for their satisfaction. It might be one or two such questions that arise, or to know the answer to one or two such questions, it doesn't have to be known directly; whether online or otherwise, if they ask the question and get the answer within 24 hours, then I think if the pricing is a bit high, people will say, \"Okay, I am secure with continuous access to knowledgeable people or some resource.\" And if it's like that, then sometimes people might not want to spend a good amount. In that case, they will want to do the courses within a certain price.\nMuhammad: Now, you mentioned that in many cases, people carry books. We often search on Google to see what's written in those books or what the ruling is from various websites. As the next generation, if we extend this search, AI and chatbots come into play. Now, if it's like this: you ask a question, for example, you go for Tawaf and you forget how many [rounds] to read or what are the Sunnahs of Tawaf, very basic things. If you search for these things on a chatbot, and that chatbot shows you text from an authentic source. You ask, \"What are the Sunnahs of Tawaf?\" And it says, \"The Sunnahs are these, and this is from [source name] and their website.\" If a chatbot gives such authentic answers, would that be acceptable to you, or would you not trust AI at all in this case?\nFarhadul: Actually, it will depend on the source from which the AI is getting the information. If it's just copying and pasting from Google or various places, then it would be a bit reserved to trust it. But if it comes with references, or quotes from a scholar or someone, then there's no reason not to trust it. It must have a source. If it's without a source, it's difficult to trust, because I can say one thing, and someone else can say another. I saw someone do it one way, and I can explain it that way, right? So, for this reason, whether it's AI or anyone, if they can provide the original source and authentication, and if it has credibility, then it can definitely be accepted. But if it just copies and pastes information, then it should not be accepted, or it's not possible to accept it.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's talk about the Hajj rituals. When you performed Hajj, did you follow a printed book for the rituals, or did you use a mobile app to read the duas and follow the Hajj and Umrah rituals?\nFarhadul: In some cases, books were used, and in some, mobile apps were used. Actually, there are two things. If I take a book, sometimes it's like a syllabus, and sometimes it's like a suggestion. A book is like a syllabus. It contains a lot of things. When I need what, what is necessary, where I need what – I have to search and find it. It's often time-consuming. And the internet is like a suggestion. What should I do in the situation I am in? Immediately, the specific thing appears there. So, in that case, the internet or online seemed more emphasized or important to me. For example, when I have leisure time, I read a book and learned things in detail. For that, a book is fine. But for doing something quickly in the short term, online is the best option.\nMuhammad: Now, if there is an app where all the Hajj rituals are beautifully presented in a checklist format, like the rules for Tawaf, the rules for Sai, and the rules for performing Umrah, everything is given as a checklist, and you can follow these things very quickly. You find the checklist, what duas to recite where, and notifications appear. For example, when you start Hajj, when you go to Mina, notifications appear about what you need to do in Mina, and you open that page and see. Something like how to make dua in Arafat also appears. And the duas that you have to recite regularly from Sahih Muslim, those duas also appear. Plus, you can also note down some of your own duas within that app. If an app provides you with such facilities, do you think such an app would be beneficial for pilgrims?\nFarhadul: Absolutely, absolutely, because, as I said before, there's a syllabus and there's a suggestion. This is like a suggestion that tells me how to perform things perfectly at these specific times. And a book is a complete book, it might be 60, 70, or 120 pages. So, it's difficult to memorize everything or to perform things perfectly time to time. And it's also difficult to quickly flip through the pages of a book to find the right position or what's written where. So, in that regard, this thing is much easier and helpful if such an app supports it.\nMuhammad: So, would you prefer this kind of app to be free, or do you think pilgrims would be willing to pay something for it?\nFarhadul: Now, if they have to make a minimum payment, maybe in some cases they might, but I don't think pilgrims would pay too much. But if it's in Bangladeshi Taka, perhaps an amount like 500-1000, or 500-700, or 600, in that case, they might take such an app. This is because this app is actually a one-time thing. After Hajj, since a person usually performs Hajj only once, its utility doesn't remain for someone who has already performed Hajj. That's why I don't think they would invest or spend too much on it. The cheaper it is, the better. Of course, if it's free, then it will have a huge number of users. Many people will accept it. So, the app company might then cover their costs in other ways, for marketing purposes, they could then earn a huge income. Because if it's a good app, people will be fascinated by it, and most of them will be eager to use it.\nMuhammad: Okay, so let's take a 15-minute break for prayer. I will call you back in 15 minutes to ask you some more questions about logistics, is that alright?\nFarhadul: Yes, no problem.\nMuhammad: Okay, Assalamu Alaikum.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMuhammad: Okay, so after this, what I wanted to know is, we've finished with the rituals part; now we want to know about the logistical matters. You were in Saudi Arabia for quite some time during Hajj or Umrah, almost 40 days. During that time, you visited many places, and you performed Ziyarah in various areas. So, if you were to go again in the future, even alone, do you think an interactive guide for those who go without an agency, where they can see each place on a map, its significance, and how to get there, would be helpful?\nFarhadul: This would definitely be very helpful because, basically, when you go for Ziyarah, the thing that happens is that every place has a historical background, which we often don't know and just pass by. When we know the background, its importance increases significantly, and everything becomes different and more enjoyable. When we went in a group, it often didn't happen that way because there was only one team leader who would explain, but we went in groups of 40, 60, sometimes 100, two or three buses carrying 100 to 150 people, but only one or two team leaders were explaining these things, and it wasn't sufficient for so many people. In that case, if there's something with modern technology, or something that provides descriptions in different languages, for example, in Bengali for Bangladeshis, or in their own languages for people from other countries, and a person can listen to these descriptions while walking around. They can listen on the way. Knowing about things that are on the way when traveling from one place to another is very important. And if an app can guide you with navigation, in that case, you often have to depend on the drivers. They sometimes charge excessive fares or exaggerate distances, giving various explanations. In that case, this would be helpful.\nMuhammad: In that case, you are talking about three things: firstly, which places are worth visiting; secondly, the authentic reason why the place is so important or what happened there, because each place is connected to something – perhaps a Companion, or our Prophet, or some Islamic event; knowing these detailed descriptions would be very helpful and important, and would reveal the true purpose. And many might show only a limited number of places, but if you have special instructions, you can take a taxi or a bus from here, then that would be very convenient for you.\nFarhadul: This, definitely, definitely, you can spend time as you wish.\nMuhammad: Okay, now for a different kind of question. You're a restaurant entrepreneur yourself. So, you know how important services like Trip Advisor are for entrepreneurs. Now, in Makkah and Madinah, there are many people. But they don't actually know where to find good food, where to get a bargain deal? Then, which markets to visit, where to buy dates in Madinah? How to go to Kakia Wholesale Market in Makkah? In this case, if there was a local business directory, and you could search, and it provided pricing. You could go here, it has a five-star rating, the service is like this, the price is like this – if there were such detailed guidelines, and if it was crowd-sourced review, do you think it would be beneficial for both local businessmen there and for pilgrims?\nFarhadul: This would definitely be beneficial. For example, for the first 10-15 days, almost two weeks after I arrived, I was collecting data. By data collection, I mean I was talking to various people, asking where I should go to buy certain things, or certain types of food, or shopping for gifts, where it would be cheaper, what kind of prices to expect. If this kind of information could be found easily from a specific online source, it would save a lot of time. For example, for short-term visitors, those going only for Umrah or on short-term Hajj packages, it would be very helpful.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, now let's talk about agency communication. When you were there during the days of Hajj or various events, the agency communicated with you, and the means of communication was WhatsApp. How effective do you think that was?\nFarhadul: WhatsApp is definitely effective for communication. But if something better could be found, if there was a better source, it would be even more so. Because sometimes, not everything can be covered with WhatsApp. In that case, if there was something else, it would be better. But for communicating in a group, since WhatsApp is currently the most widely used app, we are used to it, which is why it feels good to us. At one time, people used to rely on Viber, and before that, only normal messages. Now WhatsApp is more convenient. If something better could be introduced, it would definitely be good. Because it also has many drawbacks. For example, sometimes things don't happen or can't be done. So, in that case, if there's any idea for something like that, it's definitely good. Because technology is advancing day by day.\nMuhammad: Okay. So, if there was a Hajj and Umrah-specific app, just for communication. How do you envision it? What kind of Hajj and Umrah-specific communication app? It would definitely be good if it could fulfill all the necessary requirements. What features would you like to see in a specific communication app? What would be good?\nFarhadul: What is now the communication app should allow individual communication with each pilgrim from time to time, and also group communication. Then, location sharing, and also information on what activities to do at different times during Hajj, what needs to be done when – these things are also possible through WhatsApp, but if it could be organized more beautifully, quickly, it might be even better. Also, I don't know, because sometimes the internet can be a factor. Sometimes, due to internet jam or blockage, using the internet can be very tough. The network might not be good, and communication might not happen on time. In those times, if something could be done like an offline feature, that would be even better.\nMuhammad: I understand. So, if it were like this, say, Hajj and their detailed plan, as you mentioned, were provided as events. Where you could see your entire trip itinerary and the main events, like \"we are going to Mecca,\" \"we are going to Medina,\" and then some live events could pop up, for example, \"a Halaka (religious gathering) will be held.\" This event would appear here in event form, like a calendar. You would see today's events appearing as notifications. Regarding location sharing, you could share your location within the group. In this case, you could share your location with fellow pilgrims in your group, or those you trust, and your agency would also know your location. You think this would be very beneficial, right? Now, we come to the very last part. If you were to go for Umrah again, would you prefer to go through an agency, or would you prefer to book everything yourself and go for Umrah alone?\nFarhadul: Actually, it will depend on the situation. Because many times, if we try to do it ourselves, sometimes it's cheap, and sometimes it becomes expensive. Agencies are sometimes cheap, sometimes expensive. So, before making a decision, I would definitely analyze the market in both ways: what kind of facilities I get if I go through an agency and what my expenses are. And if I go individually and personally, what will be my total expenses. So, I will choose whatever seems more convenient to me. It's difficult to say in advance. Because sometimes, agencies have corporate deals with various hotels or transportation providers. They often get a special discount, and from that discount, they give some discount to their clients. And sometimes, if I go alone, I won't get that discount. And sometimes, thinking about their profit margin, they often set high prices. But if I go individually, and since I might not need the support they provide, as I now know many things myself, if I feel that I can minimize costs and do a program individually, then I might prefer my personal program or tour. It really depends because sometimes we book hotels through booking websites because we often get discounted rates there. Sometimes we book hotels face-to-face because we get cheaper rates from them, and sometimes we find cheaper rates on booking.com due to promotions. So, it really depends on the situation. Just before going, I would analyze what's best for me.\nMuhammad: Now, regarding online booking, there are many online booking sites like booking.com, Expedia, and some smaller sites like [inaudible]. Then, for flights, there's [inaudible], these are many new sites, and they are offering deals at much cheaper rates than booking.com and Expedia in many cases, and each of them provides a verified registration and printable hotel documents. Huh?\nMuhammad: So, what do you think about the trust factor in hotel booking? I mean, if a new provider comes along and offers significantly cheaper deals, would people be willing to abandon larger providers like booking.com or Expedia and buy from the new ones?\nFarhadul: In the beginning, any new business has to go through a crisis period to gain trust. In that case, marketing is a very big thing. If some people can be attracted through promotions or extra discounts, and if honest service is provided to them and good reviews are obtained from them, then I think even if there's a struggle for the first six or seven months to a year, there won't be a problem later. Because if I go to a site now and want to buy a ticket, make a booking, I have to make a payment. Now, if I see that 50 people have given a five-star review, then I'll think it has authentication, it's trustworthy. Okay, booking.com has 5000 reviews, they [the new site] have 50 or 60, but no one has given a bad comment or a bad review about their financial service. So, then I might think, \"No, I'll see that I'm getting a 10 to 15-20% discount here compared to the price I have to pay there.\" Then I will prioritize that discount, and since they have few but good reviews, I will take it from them. And eventually, after two or three years, as reviews increase, their trust will ultimately increase, everything will be fine. But in the very beginning, there might be some problems, in which case it might need to be covered by extra discounts, extra promotions, and some marketing costs.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, so now we come to our very last segment, regarding your post-Hajj spirituality. What kind of support system do you think could help maintain the spirit of Hajj after it's over, the idea that Hajj is a spiritual boost where life before Hajj and life after Hajj are completely different?\nFarhadul: Actually, after completing Hajj, many people return to their old routines and busy lives. They go back to their old life. It's seen that then, amidst their normal busy routines, the spiritual aspects of Hajj, the things that actually happen during Hajj, gradually fade from memory. Then they become busy again with normal life or worldly life. In this case, I think, just like we have the five daily calls to prayer to go to Salat. What's the reason for that? It's a repeated reminder. If an app or something similar could be made where a person installs it, and it gives them pop-up messages, reminders, or activities from time to time, every day, or on a specific day of the week, or at a specific time, or on weekends, holidays, or Fridays, to live by later. In this way, the spirit of Hajj might be maintained in a person for a long time or for many years. Otherwise, at some point, they won't have anyone reminding them. They get busy with their own life, their own lifestyle, their work, business, family. Then, gradually, with these problems, the spirit starts to diminish significantly. Since we are not all very practicing Muslims here, and we are very busy with our fast-paced lives, if something could be invented or innovated to remind us repeatedly, for example, just like many people set Azan on their mobile phones, so an automatic Azan plays at prayer times. They set alarms on their watches. Just like an automatic time alarm, the watch alarms to wake them up. Notifications are set in calendars for events or issues to be notified. Similarly, in daily life, at a specific time, like during Isha or Fajr, or before or after Jumu'ah, if something could be done with emphasis on Hajj. Since everyone uses smartphones now, a message or a notification comes, they see it, do some worship, some good deeds. In this way, the spirit of Hajj can remain within them. I think if someone thinks about it, it's a good thought. Thank you.\nMuhammad: Okay, so if we bring in the Facebook model here, like how a social networking site works, if we think of a social networking app but in a very limited scope, where you can add people you met during Hajj as friends, and then you can share your memories and everything with them, would that be good?\nFarhadul: This is memory stability, plus the subsequent activities. It has been observed that for one or two years, on a weekly basis, some resources come to them, like how to perform an act of worship this week, or how we can have a discussion on Hajj, or notifications about various activities happening in different places can come to them, and they can choose to view these activities. So, this kind of thing would be good.\nMuhammad: Okay, our interview ends here. Thank you very much. Just to summarize, we discussed a Hajj app that could have various features. You felt that if it were free, pretty much everyone would use it. And if we kept some features free, but charged up to 10 dollars, we would still get some users, but maybe not as many as if it were completely free. So, we discussed various features. Just to conclude, if I were to ask for your opinion, if you were to go for Hajj again and an app like this already existed, would you use it if it were free, or would you still use it even if you were charged up to 10 dollars?\nFarhadul: Now, since we who have already performed Hajj have some resources, we know some things about how to do it, and we are already guided, we don't think we would spend additional money for this. This might be for those who are completely new; they might do it because they have a curiosity to complete it well. Since we have already gone through it, but if it's free, then we would definitely consider using it to memorize things again or to see if we find anything new. In that case, those who go for the second time would probably want to use something free; they probably wouldn't want to incur an extra cost for it because they have already been through this path, and the path is largely familiar to them.\nMuhammad: Okay, thank you very much for your valuable time. Insha'Allah, we will share further updates with you. Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.\nFarhadul: Okay. Walaikum Assalam."

    "english_transcript": "[Note: Timestamps are not available in the provided source excerpts.]\nMuhammad: This meeting is recorded. Assalamu Alaikum, brother. I will just give a little context, Inshallah. Last month, I participated in a studio program called Hasan BC, Alhamdullilah. After participating there, everyone had to do customer validation for a startup idea. The idea I am working on is related to Hajj and Umrah. In this regard, since you have performed Hajj and Umrah, I will ask you some questions, Inshallah. And the goal is, Inshallah, to extract some insights from you on how we can solve the problems of Hajj and Umrah using technology, Inshallah.\nMuhammad: Brother, first, let me know your name.\nHasan Mahmud: Yes, my name is Ataullah Hasan Mahmud.\nMuhammad: Okay, age?\nHasan Mahmud: My age is 39 years.\nMuhammad: Okay. So brother, what year did you perform Hajj?\nHasan Mahmud: I performed Hajj in 2009-10.\nMuhammad: You did it twice?\nHasan Mahmud: No, the 9-10 was actually November. And it was the end of December. So we had some overlap at the end, within two months.\nMuhammad: Okay, and how many times have you performed Umrah?\nHasan Mahmud: I have performed Umrah twice. The last time was in March 2025.\nMuhammad: Meaning this year?\nMuhammad: This year, did you book everything yourself and go alone, or did you go with an agency?\nHasan Mahmud: I actually did everything myself. From my flight booking to the visa, which was definitely taken through an intermediary. But all other tasks, I did according to my own way.\nMuhammad: Okay, you have performed Umrah before. When you performed Umrah before, did you go by yourself or did you go with an agency then?\nHasan Mahmud: Only for Hajj, I went through an agency. For the other two Umrahs, I went on my own, with my own arrangements.\nMuhammad: Okay. So, arranging everything yourself is a bit of a hassle. Still, why did you choose to do it yourself instead of going through an agency?\nMuhammad: Yes, I didn't understand, could you repeat that please?\nMuhammad: When you are doing these things yourself, you chose to arrange everything yourself, whereas you could have bought a package from an agency according to your preference. It seems like a hassle to arrange everything yourself and talk repeatedly. Wouldn't it be easier to go on a group tour? Why did you choose to go by yourself? Why did you choose to go?\nHasan Mahmud: Well, firstly, for choosing to go by myself, the first thing was that I could choose my preferred time, then choose the hotels where I would stay, and I could design my journey time as I wished. That's why I actually arranged all the transportation myself, keeping comfort in mind, so that I could cater to my comfort at the highest level, meaning, in my own way. That's why I arranged everything myself.\nMuhammad: Okay, what was your cost per person per trip?\nHasan Mahmud: Since I went for the first time, it cost us three people. For the recent time, which was in 2025, it cost us around 1 lakh 40 thousand altogether per person. Since I had a child with me, there were some discounts on flight fares. But other than food and everything, I managed to arrange everything for around 1 lakh 40 thousand with a very good discount.\nMuhammad: Okay, were you able to do this because you went by yourself? Do you think booking yourself instead of going through an agency costs less, or is the cost the same?\nHasan Mahmud: If you go through an agency, it would cost less in some areas, I know that. That is, for flights and some hotels. But those hotels are often far away, so I prefer to stay closer. If you go through an agency, hotels that are so close usually cost more. Sometimes, what you book from here might not be to your liking because there are many hotels within such a short distance.\nMuhammad: Okay, so when you went, did you compare prices with online services like Booking.com or similar?\nHasan Mahmud: No, I primarily booked hotels in Medina through Agoda when I went. Agoda. And for Mecca, I actually visited physically there myself. At that time, I took the best price hotel that was in the nearest position. So you didn't book any hotel from Bangladesh for Mecca, you went there yourself? No, I actually didn't book any hotel in Mecca. This was in March 2025. And for the previous one, I had booked both because there weren't as many hotels on Agoda back then. But for that, I got locals there to find a hotel for me, and I paid them some money to confirm it.\nMuhammad: Do you have local contacts there who work with hotels?\nHasan Mahmud: They don't do business. Some brothers I know, I told them the location through them, and they booked it that way.\nMuhammad: Oh, I see, I understand. And you just paid them when you got there?\nHasan Mahmud: Yes, mostly we paid from Dhaka.\nMuhammad: Oh, you didn't have to pay any money in Dhaka? You paid when you got there, right?\nHasan Mahmud: No, I paid some here. And I paid the rest when I got there.\nMuhammad: Okay. So when you went and booked flights, did you compare the prices with agencies? Or do you assume agencies cost a bit less?\nHasan Mahmud: No, I actually didn't break down the agency costs like that. They usually don't tell you how much it is for the flight specifically; they give a total combined booking. In that case, sometimes for booking, there are issues with weight and other things, and and you pretty much have to adjust with their arrangements.\nMuhammad: Okay.\nHasan Mahmud: It seems they are giving the same price, but it turns out that someone else who is going with me—I heard a complaint from one of our brothers—that they might have been given 20 kg or 30 kg on Saudi Airlines, but someone else could carry 40 kg, yet both paid the same total cost. Meaning, the weight allowances of one person or even four people were taken up by another person. I understand this.\nMuhammad: Okay, so now you've booked online from Agoda, booked yourself, and been for Hajj. Which one did you find most convenient? I mean, if you go next time, if you have three options: booking from booking.com in Bangladesh, booking by yourself when you get there, or booking through an agency, which one is the easiest for you and most convenient?\nHasan Mahmud: It actually depends on who will be travelling with me on the journey. It depends a lot on that. If it's bachelors or solo travelers, because now the visa is open, for solo travelers, I would say the cheapest option is to book a hotel when you get there. When you book there, you can get the best price, I can take that. And another thing is to keep rush hour in mind. During rush hour, sometimes this deal might not work well. If you book much earlier through Agoda, you can get the advantage there.\nMuhammad: Okay, so you would prefer one of these two, but not from an [best guess: agency].\nHasan Mahmud: No, definitely when my family goes, I will definitely book at least the first hotel beforehand. Because it's a bit difficult to take a chance like that with family.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, what kind of hotels did you take? How far were they from the Haram and what kind of hotels were they?\nHasan Mahmud: The hotel I took in Medina was right after one hotel from Madinah Munawwarah, meaning just after the premises, there was a hotel next to it. The one right after that, I might be able to tell you the name if I check.\nMuhammad: No need for the name.\nHasan Mahmud: In Mecca, what it was, I physically booked it there. It was right after one hotel past Jabal Omar.\nMuhammad: I understand.\nHasan Mahmud: This, this actually was the best price I found there at that time, I got it at a very good price.\nMuhammad: I understand. So, were you satisfied with your hotel service?\nHasan Mahmud: Yes, I was satisfied with the hotel service.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, and when you travelled in Mecca and Medina, maybe there are spots now, like several mountains, Jabal Sur, and then there are many mosques, and the Cave of Hira, there are many such places. In Medina, there are many places. How did you visit these, or did you not visit them?\nHasan Mahmud: No, I visited them. I spoke to some local people there and booked a taxi to travel to those places. So, it was done by agreement with them to go to those places.\nMuhammad: Oh, okay, did you use Uber or Careem?\nHasan Mahmud: I used Uber, but I faced an issue with Uber. Since we go from Bangladesh, we have some trouble with payment. Online payment is not possible. Cash payment is possible. Okay. Since my international transaction, Uber cannot take charge. But other than that, if I paid cash, I used it for my journey.\nMuhammad: Okay, overall, how was your experience with taxis and transportation? When you went there, you booked and worked there?\nHasan Mahmud: You're talking about taxi experience with Uber?\nMuhammad: Taxi.\nHasan Mahmud: Taxis are a bit costly. I think they are very costly for us. Because actually, everything is very costly now. Overall, if we calculate food cost, taxi, transport, everything has become much more expensive. Except for public transport. If you use public transport, it might be a bit less. But then it's very expensive. Only Mecca and Medina are very expensive.\nMuhammad: I understand. You traveled from Mecca to Medina by taxi, right?\nHasan Mahmud: Yes.\nMuhammad: You traveled from Mecca to Medina by taxi, right?\nHasan Mahmud: No, I came from Medina to Mecca.\nMuhammad: Yes, you came by taxi, right?\nHasan Mahmud: I came by taxi, yes.\nMuhammad: Did you ever try the train service?\nHasan Mahmud: I wanted to try the train service. But since I have a child with me, considering everything like going from Haram to the railway station, and after getting off there, then coming from Medina, the transport medium, everything, it becomes very expensive. That's why I didn't use it. Considering my time convenience, taxi was preferable for me.\nMuhammad: Okay, and for the various sightseeing spots, you didn't take any guide? You only took a taxi, right?\nHasan Mahmud: I took a taxi, and mostly, since there are various apps, the significance of those locations are available in some places, and mostly it's in English now. Many places have it in English.\nMuhammad: I understand. Now, if it's like this, when you went there for shopping and eating, do you think you could easily find good places to eat and where to shop? Shopping was a bit difficult because you actually have to go outside the Haram area, and around the Haram area, it's very expensive. And primarily, the food is very expensive, that's what I'm saying, I mean, it's very expensive. I understand.\nHasan Mahmud: It was very expensive comparatively, and it's increasing day by day.\nMuhammad: Okay, now if I give you an option, say if you are given an app where all the locations of places you want to visit are provided. When you go to those locations, there will be an audio or video clip or some text explaining why that place is famous, its significance, okay? And if there's an itinerary plan for you, then some pre-arranged group tours for you. Then, some deals for shops where you can go shopping, some discounts in those shops, some coupons. If these things are provided to you through an app, would it add value to your trip?\nHasan Mahmud: Yes, it would definitely add value. This would certainly be very helpful. Because we usually find this information by scattered Google searches. And the main thing is, if it's available as an app, even services, like some taxi services there, if we can capture them through such apps, like this taxi will pick you up after some time and drop you at a certain location, then it would be very helpful for pilgrims who are new and going individually without a group. And since the Saudi government has now opened it up, this thing would be very helpful for pilgrims.\nMuhammad: I understand.\nHasan Mahmud: Definitely, it will be helpful even if they go in a group, they will know.\nMuhammad: Okay, I understand. So, if you had to pay a one-time fee for this, would you be comfortable paying it?\nHasan Mahmud: About the fee?\nMuhammad: Suppose the app guides you through various places for Ziyarah, shows you benefits of different places, plus shares deals and locations of some shops with discounts and coupons. Would you be interested in paying a one-time fee for something like this?\nHasan Mahmud: Yes, some fee, if it's not marginal. It would be a one-time activity. If some fee, around 500 to 1000 Taka, it would still be a good suggestion and make everything easy.\nMuhammad: Okay, from the bus.\nHasan Mahmud: Like bearing five to ten dollars, right?\nMuhammad: Yes, 5 to 10 dollars.\nHasan Mahmud: Okay, but if it's less than 5 to 10 dollars, 5 dollars is very much convenient for all.\nMuhammad: Yes, the dollar amount.\nMuhammad: Okay, so what do you think, if there is an app, what other areas can it help you with? For example, specifically if I talk about Umrah, there are many rituals like Tawaf, Sa'i. We don't do these daily, and in such cases, many of us carry books. So, do you think this app could be an alternative to a book?\nHasan Mahmud: Actually, in that case, I don't want to use an app as an alternative because sometimes I want to keep away from devices. Because if you have an app in hand, other notifications often pop up, and attention also shifts. I actually think a little differently, so I would prefer to stay away from apps in that way. And there are many other apps related to this, for example, Nusuk app already has many duas and these things available. Besides this, what can be added is, first of all, if someone goes without a group, food arrangement can be done. And in the case of Haram, any national announcements they make. There are some announcements that come in Nusuk, but they come in Arabic. They also come in English, but often with a delay. But many announcements come in Arabic. And if things like prayer times and congregational prayer times come at once, it becomes much easier. Sometimes, the Adhan cannot be heard from the hotel room, and prayer times are often missed since there is a big time difference for us.\nMuhammad: What if there was an option, a ritual mode, where when you are doing Tawaf or Sa'i, everything is shown to you in offline mode, your Tawaf rituals. And then your phone would turn on Do Not Disturb mode, so no notifications or calls would come. You would just fully focus. And when you exit ritual mode, your phone would go back to normal, calls and SMS would come, and you could see your missed calls or any issues. If there was something like that, would you use the app instead of a book?\nHasan Mahmud: Yes, in that case, it can be done. And if it's for one's own work, then it can be skipped. But this is more convenient. Apps usually don't have such a mode. If there's a focus mode, then only missed calls or similar things notify, and the rest are ignored.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay. Now let's talk about family management. You mentioned taking your family. So, sometimes people get lost there. There are elderly people, and communication is needed. Do you think an app can play an effective role in this, or can WhatsApp, or WhatsApp location be enough? Actually, an app is not needed in this case.\nHasan Mahmud: If it's like this, that since many people take a SIM card there, we Bangladeshis usually take one SIM card, but mobile SIMs are very expensive. In that case, if it can be done using some Bluetooth technology to find the nearest location, that would be very easy. Like creating hops. And besides that, if it's done through tags, like finding lost items, this is very helpful. Otherwise, for communication, other apps are always available. But if such an app can be found, then communication becomes easy. I don't know if those AirTags use any SIM cards, but if they can be used, it would be very good.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay, so if we talk about SIMs, now there are many eSIM providers. So, if you were offered a SIM with only top-up time, only data, where you can only use communication apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and maybe location, with very limited data, or an app where you can communicate and see locations but no voice calls, but you have to pay for an eSIM, and its price would be very low, would you be interested in buying such an eSIM?\nHasan Mahmud: Yes, if the eSIM is cheap, then it can certainly be bought. But buying a SIM for around 20 Riyals or 15 Riyals is a bit difficult. But other than that, if it's an eSIM and it can be used on many supported sets, then there's no problem.\nMuhammad: I understand. Okay. Now let's talk a bit about Hajj. You performed Hajj in 2009 although it was a bit ago. But you probably know that Hajj is a very exhaustive spiritual exercise. And in this case, training is needed. Also, after Hajj, we often get so engaged in worldly affairs that we lose the essence of Hajj. In that case, if there was a mobile-based six-month to one-year program. Six months before Hajj and six months after Hajj. For example, you would start six months before Hajj. You would be trained on various aspects of Hajj. And you would be fully prepared for Hajj. There would be lectures from various Islamic scholars, modules that you would complete, and various lectures on logistics by Hajj trainers. And after returning from Hajj, for the next six months, you would be trained on how to maintain the spirit of Hajj. And for this training, for example, you would have to buy some modules for a small fee. Post-Hajj and Pre-Hajj. Would you be interested in such an EdTech platform?\nHasan Mahmud: Actually, in this case, from six months before, I wouldn't be very involved in that way. I might do six months of study, but I wouldn't be too involved in that way from six months beforehand. Usually, it would be three months. I might be connected for three months. But in this case, there are some issues with apps regarding how long and what type of suggestions I would get. A lot depends on that.\nMuhammad: For suggestions, you would have a pre-Hajj course and a self-paced Hajj course. Here, your Hajj rituals, like Hadith Jibreel, and other Hadiths, then how to make Duas during Hajj, so that you can go for Hajj spiritually prepared. There will be some courses like this that you will prepare, and here you will be given a percentage based on how prepared you are for Hajj. Three months before, you will be given a beautiful guideline, and you will study according to that, like a university semester, but it's self-paced. And also, after returning from Hajj, how you can maintain the spirit of Hajj, so that the things you did during Hajj for 15-20 days or one month become your habit. And it would be like this: you might make various pledges to yourself during Hajj, like, \"Okay, after going home, I will pray five times in the mosque,\" or \"I will read the Quran regularly.\" Such things, you will pledge to yourself, and they will give you reminders so that you can stick to your pledges. If we do something like this, do you think it would add value?\nHasan Mahmud: If it's a one-time payment, then yes. And for one-time payments, most people, I might invest, I mean, I might use it in some cases. But mostly, since our payment issue is a bit of a hassle, having to pay through Google with a card every time, in that case, I might not do it always, but for a one-time payment, I would. If it's subscription-based, perhaps an amount like 500-600 Taka, I would go up to that for a one-time entry.\nMuhammad: I see. So, for that reason, everything is bundled: pre-Hajj, post-Hajj training, Hajj ritual and Ziyarah guidance during Hajj, and other deals. If all of this is bundled together in one app, how much would you be willing to pay?\nHasan Mahmud: Which one, again?\nMuhammad: We discussed that, yes, everything for Hajj, ritual guidance during Hajj, then where to go for good shopping during Hajj, historical places, plus pre and post Hajj guidance. If we offer all this together as a bundle, how much would you be interested in paying?\nHasan Mahmud: Actually, instead of offering it as a bundle, first of all, if we can see the app in the initial stage, that it will charge me this much first, then if I want to take the next module section, it will add this much, then I mean, so that it can be chosen that way. And if it's bundled, up to 1500, I mean, if it's 10 dollars, 10 to 12 dollars at most.\nMuhammad: Okay, I think that makes sense. So brother, thank you for your time.\nMuhammad: And today, these were mainly the questions. If you have any further suggestions on how my idea can help the Hajj and Umrah journey, especially regarding Duas for Hajj, we make Duas, we perform rituals, anything else, you can share it with us. Or if I rephrase the question, if you were asked about your technological wish list, something you believe would truly be a game-changer for people performing Hajj and Umrah, if you could share that, we could conclude with that.\nHasan Mahmud: Actually, it depends on who is traveling. If it's many solo travelers or families who want to travel, if they can be given a total guideline and complete training, then many people will certainly take it from the app. But it is seen that many people want to go but are afraid, \"Will I find a hotel?\", \"How will I pick it?\" These guidelines are not updated, and many things change in Saudi government rules and regulations. Because of not knowing these, many people go through agencies, and agencies also keep people in such a way that they feel they must go through them. And not all agencies, particularly many agencies, want to focus on this. And those of us who work, we mostly want some flexibility. Flexibility in time. Because of holidays, everything combined with family, when people want to go, that's when flexibility comes into play. If these things can be done, meaning it can be portioned out. For those going in groups, it will be one way. And for solo travelers, even if they want to invest a little more money, if they get these supports, then people will go solo. Meaning, I mean, in small groups.\nMuhammad: I understand. For example, if I ask, \"How do I go from Jeddah to Mecca?\" Some tips could be given: how to go, what can't be done, what can be done. If these things are added, giving tips, or where to find a car, where is the location, how Uber will work, where to buy a SIM—these are small queries that we think are easily found, but when people get there, many panic. They also have many options now, and these might change day by day.\nMuhammad: I have understood. Okay, brother. Thank you for your time. Inshallah, we will talk again sometime later. Thank you. Assalamu Alaikum."

    "english_transcript": "[00:00] Muhammad: Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi, brother, thank you for giving us your time. Insha'Allah today we will have a short discussion with you and explore what problems exist in the Umrah sector and what challenges Hajj agency operators face, which we hope to solve through technology. We are thinking of some solutions and will also take solutions from you, Insha'Allah. So, first, let's talk about you. What we know is that, Alhamdulillah, you are the proprietor of a reputed agency in Chittagong, Goziara, and you are successfully providing services for Hajj and Umrah to the people of Bangladesh. So, right at the beginning, I want to know about the current licensing system for Hajj and Umrah in Bangladesh, the Nusuk hotel booking system of the Saudi government, and the entire challenge of paperwork between the government and the Saudi government. What challenges do you face because of this, and how are you mitigating them? And what kind of ideal situation would be the best option for you, brother, for giving me the option?\n[00:46] Muhammad: You asked about the current problem. I'm just repeating the question to ensure I've understood it correctly. You want to know what problems are arising from the new Nusuk system, right? Plus, the government has introduced a new rule that every agency must have a license to operate Umrah and advertise. In this regard, what licensing and paperwork problems are you facing, and how are you getting out of this?\n[01:13] Shirajee: Okay, number one. To do any business, you need a license, no matter what industry you are in. The government hasn't just introduced this rule; it has been a rule from before that if you want to do Hajj or Umrah business, you must have a license. Number one. Number two, for many years, you know, the issuance of Hajj licenses has been stopped. Previously, a lot of licenses were given. You will see that there are many Hajj agencies in Bangladesh. Not one or two, you will see many agencies, especially the big ones, have two to three licenses under different names for one agency. When do rules come into effect? Rules come into effect when someone breaks the rules. Due to some non-compliant agencies of this type, the Bangladesh government has stopped issuing licenses. Recently, what is happening is that Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh (HAAB) has made a list of those who have... they have listed. There are many agencies that commit fraud cases and scam pilgrims. Because of this, it's a good initiative. I pray that what happens is, rules are made or something is stopped, but they don't give a solution. I pray that the solution comes quickly. For example, you need a license. A license is a must. But they are not issuing licenses. If I acquire or buy a license from an agency now, I cannot change the name on that license. My business, my other licenses are already under the name Goziara, or License of Goziara. But this is a challenge we are facing, which is yet to be solved by the government or those in charge. Yes, but a license is the best authenticity; you will have accountability, your authenticity will be there, people will have accountability.\n[03:10] Muhammad: Here, Alhamdulillah, you mentioned trust and scams. So, actually, from all the pilgrims I've interviewed, scams and trust issues are not just a Bangladeshi problem, but a global one. Even in Malaysia, a few days ago, there was an incident where some pilgrims stayed at a Hajj camp for 10 days and were defrauded. After that, they bought new tickets and finally went for their Hajj. And this is a global problem. And you see in Bangladesh, a reputed company called Flight Expert suddenly folded their business, and those who used to do B2B business with them, meaning those who bought their tickets, also got into trouble. So, in this situation, when you want to start a new business or scale a business from small to large, the trust issue becomes a big problem. You might be working in [best guess: other] companies; there are no problems in many industries. Especially those consumer goods that people buy, see, and products are running. But perhaps the majority of people prefer not to go without a referral. But when you try to grow through referrals, what we call organic growth, even if there is growth, it is a bit slow. For example, you have 1000, they might keep more people. So, in this case, how are you mitigating this challenge, and how can technology further solidify your trust and verification?\n[04:44] Shirajee: You have caught our industry very well. The only sales here happen through referrals. So, when sales happen through referrals, what happens, as you rightly said, if a pilgrim needs your service, they will refer you. How, option number, Allah has given you an opportunity to serve the guests of Allah. Of course, it's also part of this, there's no second option, really. You have to give the best service. We pray, I will be able to take it easy, that everyone can give the best service, the kind of service the guests of Allah deserve. There are many challenges there, I hope everyone can handle that. In terms of providing service, you have to grow slowly and steadily. You have to maintain that. What do we do in our agency? We are trying to start other wings if possible. We want our business or at least for us to be at break-even. That's what we are working on. And scams, scams happen a lot because our pilgrims still, I mean, what they do is, it's such a...\n[05:58] Shirajee: ...thing, even the problem is that people are emotional, they cannot expect someone to cheat them in this industry. Here, it's really important that people check at least the minimum things that can be checked. For example, when I shop online, I at least check if that website has reviews, what percentage of reviews, etc. I check for review options on the page. For example, what will an agency actually check? Pilgrims need to be a bit more educated on this.\n[06:33] Muhammad: To solve this problem, what we are actually doing is, we are trying, Insha'Allah, to open an online shop for B2C agencies through technology and include it in an online marketplace. And in that case, we will work with them together and try to collect reviews from their verified pilgrims. Those who have at least 10, 15, however many, who have benefited from their relationship with the agency, and we will show on their public page that X, Y, Z agency had 10 pilgrims with them, and maybe some names will be there, along with their verified reviews. And in that case, what will happen is, do you think this could help solve the trust issue of referrals to some extent? And do you think agencies would be comfortable working with this?\n[07:38] Shirajee: Absolutely, if your website is built, absolutely on a trust basis, this can go a long way. You see, when the online e-commerce industry, when there were many who were not able to do it from a proper place or were giving bad things, right? I mean, you ordered something online, and you received something in return that was not as advertised. But there are some e-commerce sites, like Amazon, eBay, Daraz, AliExpress. People get cheated less from these because there is a rating-review system. Those who buy are sure that they will at least not buy something from a bad seller on Daraz. If a website or a portal can be built with [warranted] trust, what benefits is providing an escrow service. For example, when a package is sold, the financial payment from the pilgrim is not given directly to the agent but held securely by a trusted third party for a specific period. And when the pilgrim receives the service and it is verified that the service has been received, then the service is released. As far as I know, the Hajj and Umrah business is very cash-intensive...\n[09:07] Shirajee: ...business. Now, perhaps direct escrow service implementation isn't possible here. In this case, what could be an alternative so that pilgrims feel confident that they are not being scammed, and that for our service, as I said, reviews, reviews? Also, identifying companies with years of hard work, years of branding, how they are doing it. It's as you said, payment after service is difficult, but if a package costs lakhs of taka, and you have 100 pilgrims, then the agency would basically have to sell their house to do the business. Similarly for Umrah. If there is an association, it's a different story, which already exists, but I don't know how effective it is. But yes, if it's review-centric, if it's effective, and there are good companies that are licensed companies, from whom you can seek accountability. Not some company that just exists, has no investment, nothing, they just open a Facebook page online and you can deal with them. Can you hold them accountable? No, you can't. They have nothing. You won't find customers as you are doing, nor will you. Review-based and customer-centric is the only way.\n[10:43] Muhammad: Okay, now let's talk about sourcing. It is often seen that many pilgrims from Bangladesh who go for Hajj through packages have a challenge that they are getting the service, but when they compare, they find that if they booked hotels or tickets directly from Booking.com or Agoda, their cost might have been lower. For example, one pilgrim said that I went for an Umrah package with a renowned agency with my wife. The next time, for the exact same price, I could take my daughter too, and I booked it on booking.com; it was a big win for me. So, since Booking.com and Agoda can offer slightly lower general costs, and also, some Hajj-centric agencies like Umrahme directly source from Maqam, the GDS of the Saudi government, and sell to pilgrims at B2C rates. Why are Bangladeshi agencies unable to do this, and what challenges do they face in directly sourcing hotels at cheaper rates to offer pilgrims a more affordable price?\n[12:12] Shirajee: Well, we know a business principle that when demand increases, prices increase, right? So, absolutely, for Hajj, Umrah, there's no such thing as peak time or off-peak time, it's everyday. Especially now that Hajj prices have gone up a bit worldwide. How are Hajj hotels sold? They are sold in slots. For Hajj and Umrah, during Ramadan too, it's sold in slots. So, don't we see many brands offering 50-60% discounts on products? Do they really offer discounts? I don't know, but one of the major reasons they offer discounts is because they have dead stock. All their products are gone, no sizes, so they're giving them away. They're releasing products at a discount. But for Hajj and Umrah, pricing always differs. It's not like the information you gave, which is received from pilgrims, which is not 100% true, that they always get it cheaper by going directly. Rather, doing it alone often costs more. Because what does an agency do? An agency organizes several services for you and keeps a profit. For example, they give you tickets, visa, hotel, transport. Some take food, some don't. After providing so many services, they make a profit of five to six thousand Taka. Sometimes ten thousand Taka profit, which is very rare these days in this competitive market. But when a person, a pilgrim, does these things by himself, he has to pay something everywhere, right? He has to pay an amount that includes profit. No one will work without profit. If someone works without profit, it has to be a scam. So, there is no one who will do it at a loss for you. So, will you pay at one place or many places by doing it yourself? Most of the time, we see many pilgrims who later tell us, \"Brother, I've arrived without a hotel, now I can't find one, please arrange a hotel for me.\" But at that time, what happens is, the hotel prices increase a lot on the spot. So, many people are suspicious about these things. They think they are being cheated. I don't know, we use many tools in the world. These questions don't come up with other tools, only during Hajj and Umrah. So, I believe it's better to take service from a professional company. Because a professional company can serve you. When you go for Hajj, since Saudi Arabia is developing very well, Alhamdulillah, it's very... honest, say what you will, but still, they have many shortcomings, and they will. There is no second example in the world like this place. Many people are doing the same thing. So, it has to happen. No, when you go to a restaurant on a weekday, you get one kind of service, when you go on a weekend, you get another kind of service. And if you go on a government holiday, you are literally paying the same amount but you get worse service, right? Same.\n[15:19] Muhammad: No, that makes sense. So, brother, I'm coming to this point. In terms of hotel sourcing, it is currently said that agencies have some trouble sourcing hotels. Because when a hotel changes hands through several pyramid layers before reaching the pilgrims, pilgrims often have to pay almost 50% extra, which actually goes to the hotel. In this case, and it is also seen that agencies often make very little profit. Especially for Umrah, what I've heard, sometimes it's even less than 1 Taka. So, in this situation, it becomes a bit difficult to sustain the business. In many cases, to avoid these layers and source directly from hotels, what is the main challenge?\n[16:40] Shirajee: Okay, in Saudi Arabia, what's happening is, firstly, now they are... Saudi Arabia, you see in Hajj now, they are slowly cutting off agencies. Meaning, 10 agencies are given an amount, saying, \"I will serve this many pilgrims for your agency, your agency has 200 pilgrims.\" There is no agency in Bangladesh with 1000 pilgrims, perhaps only small groups or sub-agencies. So, how does Saudi Arabia handle 1000 pilgrims? The government is working like England. They never want to serve directly. What do their owners do? They sell the whole thing. They look for clients who will sell the entire thing. Many hotels are seen to be already sold for three to four years. There are even some local companies there that have leased three or four floors. So again, where demand is high, it gets resold. This is not just for Saudi Arabia; you'll see this even in a place like Cox's Bazar, hotels are sold and resold during government holidays. This happens. I was in Cox's Bazar, I've seen it. That's why we see hotel prices increase a lot. How it works, unfortunately, the chain has become this way. This is not just for Bangladesh; it's the same for the whole world.\n[18:23] Muhammad: So, when you go to do business dealings with these higher chains, do you face trouble as a Bangladeshi agency? If you were not a Bangladeshi agency but a Saudi licensed travel agency, if you were a Saudi licensed partner like Sapla Group or Account Group, do you think it would be easier for you to source in that case...?\n[18:55] Shirajee: ...it would be. If there was a local license, absolutely. Quantity, quantity of investment, large investment means you have to take large losses also, right?\n[19:11] Muhammad: Right, so whoever can do bigger, yes, if there's a Saudi license, the work is easier. That's done. Now, about service providers, there's a problem. Many say that finding reliable service providers is tough, especially for buses and taxis. It's often seen that they scam pilgrims and cause trouble. When you ensure reliable services for pilgrims, how do you source them? What are the challenges in this regard? I mean, is this really a challenge, or is it a big challenge for you? You're in a Zoom meeting. Alhamdulillah. It's about sourcing. Who are you doing business with? This is not a challenge. It's a challenge. But yes, many businesses with Saudis happen through word of mouth. A lot of money is paid without any receipt. This is a bit risky, but again, who are you doing business with? That's why it's not easy to grow. It's not easy for just anyone to come into the market and work by themselves. Because with whom are you working, you have to make an advance payment. Where is that advance payment going? If someone takes the advance payment and runs away, to whom will you complain? These challenges exist.\n[20:55] Shirajee: So, for us, speaking of Goziara. I have many sources there. Even with sources, we sometimes take from inside the country, meaning there's another agency that takes its profit from me, but I feel safe. I will make a little less profit, but I feel safe that my money, meaning the pilgrims' money, will be safe, and the service will be ensured. Choosing such companies. Again, if you go with a licensed company, your cost will be a bit higher.\n[21:28] Muhammad: So, in that case, if a third-party company, a tech startup, comes that can directly source from Saudi sources and sell to you at competitive prices, and also ensure the safety that is your concern, through a company-registered contract or agreement. In that case, you would definitely be interested in doing business with such a company. Since yours is very strong, it would solve a lot of problems, actually. The current business is like that. Let's summarize what we discussed. So, first off, let's discuss that in terms of your marketing, if an agency comes that works with you on their website, brings verified info of your pilgrims, publishes reviews, and helps you with buying and selling from there, this would be beneficial for you. And if they help you source hotels B2B at a slightly less...\n[22:45] Muhammad: ...competitive price but with safety, that would also be beneficial for you. Let's move to the next segment, guidance. People usually perform Hajj and Umrah only once. In this case, guidance is very essential for them. And often, what happens is that people want to explore a bit. Sometimes they want to visit the holy sites (ziyarat). And they often say that with an agency, they have to maintain a very rigid schedule. Maybe they have to go after Fajr, but they might have family or some issues, and they can't go at that time. They prefer some flexibility. In that case, do you think having a mobile guide instead of a direct human guide would be beneficial? A guide that would have the following features: quick shortcuts for Hajj and Umrah rituals and duas; recorded video trainings for Hajj and Umrah before the journey, which they can review as many times as they want during Hajj and Umrah; and finally, when they visit the holy sites (ziyarat), they can see the locations and maps, and their significance will be recorded there by you, which they can play to understand why those places are beneficial. On top of that, there would be a customer support system where they can talk to you to solve any logistical or Sharia-related problems. Do you think this would be a game-changing situation for you? And in this case, if a physical person is not required, would you offer some packages that would be more affordable for pilgrims? Would you offer them further discounts if they use a mobile guide?\n[24:59] Shirajee: Physical guides actually don't cost much. And in our country, it's going to be difficult because people are very in touch with technology. And in some places, they don't want to use technology. Work or benefit Big B. We want to send many pilgrims with customized packages. You go, you do everything yourself. They don't want to do it themselves. I mean, it's difficult if we teach them this way. People need to be brought out of the mindset that it's very difficult. You need individual guidance, but for Umrah, you can go by yourself and see everything. The resources you are talking about are already available. They are already getting them through Google. Yes, unorgani...\n[25:57] Shirajee: ...zed way, or by searching, they are getting it. So, no matter how much we push pilgrims to go alone, 'Go your Hajj, you go to UK, you go to America'. You can go to Singapore and do everything by yourself, visit Malaysia, go to Dubai. But when it comes to Dubai, for some reason, pilgrims behave very childishly, saying, 'No, I need someone, someone.' We have often seen that even if we offer very good deals, very good hotels in terms of pricing, in terms of flights, pilgrims won't go. Pilgrims will go with someone, they will go in a group. They need a group. Hajj, or Hajj, must definitely be done in a group, but even for Umrah, they look for a group.\n[26:56] Muhammad: So, you are saying that for the ziyarat, some things can be automated, meaning pilgrims prefer a physical person to stand and narrate. They are happier with the agency. I understand. So, in that case, do you think if such an option comes, you would be interested in selling it as an optional add-on with your packages? For example, the market price is 1500 Taka, but if they buy it from you, maybe they would get it as an add-on for 1400 Taka. Completely optional. But in your case, you would have to promote it. Would you be interested in this, or has it not been [acknowledged] in the Bangladesh market with the package yet, but maybe it can be done?\n[27:52] Shirajee: In fact, we do it in the form of banners, small videos. We already tell the pilgrims about where they are going and what's there the day before. But still, when they go there, they want a physical person.\n[28:11] Muhammad: Option. Now let's move on to the last point, which is Customer Relationship Management. Since it's a referral business, it's often seen that even if someone went for Hajj, maybe a year later, many more of their relatives or friends will go for Hajj. But pilgrims often don't refer. So, in this case, would a Customer Reference Management system be helpful where you can see which pilgrims are going, maintain a systematic regular relationship with them, send greetings, and politely ask them if they have any relatives or friends whom you'd be interested in serving? Such a system. Then there's your internal organization, meaning the administrative tasks of company management that everyone usually does through Excel. Then tracking a sale. For example, the journey from lead to conversion of that sale. This...\n[29:20] Muhammad: ...whole journey, would tracking it be helpful for you? If there's an integrated software that saves your time and ensures data privacy, where data will be entirely on your Google Drive. It will access data on demand, but not store data anywhere. If any software provides such a service to you, would you be interested in using it for a small subscription fee?\n[29:56] Shirajee: It would be very nice. It would be very organized if it's very organized and easy to use.\n[30:05] Muhammad: Lastly, let's talk about communication. We see that most pilgrims communicate through WhatsApp. When communicating via WhatsApp, what happens is that your communication gets lost, and often, many important messages cannot be tagged. But from another perspective, WhatsApp is a very excellent solution. In that case, what we are thinking is that we will have some subscriber numbers. Through which we will extract messages from WhatsApp and extract intelligence using AI. And these will be shared with each agency, only with their WhatsApp group, on an on-demand basis. In the case of such WhatsApp intelligence software, would you be interested? Do you think it would add value?\n[31:07] Shirajee: Yes, it will add value, Insha'Allah.\n[31:14] Muhammad: Okay, Shirajee Bhai, thank you very much for giving your time. This interview with you was very valuable, and we are planning to do something like this, Insha'Allah. Please pray that Allah gives us the opportunity to work with you, and we hope, Insha'Allah, when we launch, we will have you as one of our esteemed partners.\n[31:40] Shirajee: Okay, brother, Assalamu Alaikum."
